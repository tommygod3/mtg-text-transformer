Title|Comment
I'm Paulo Vitor Damo da Rosa (PVDDR), AMA!|How do you feel about the entirety of this last Worlds being played on Arena? Do you prefer digital over paper?
Further your scientific understanding with the Periodic Table of Creature Subtypes|I don't see how this will ever be useful to me but take this upvote for the effort
Repeated Reverberations rulings text is great. What are other examples of funny rulings text?|This is a joke on all math proofs that you ever see in a grad level math class. Other one is proof is trivial to the reader
I love Ryusei's promo art by Nottsuo so much i decided to paint him on a canvas and will be hanging it in my living room!|Amazing work! I’m rather fond of that art also, still have mine from my very first pre-release.
Last Minute Ikoria Speculation: Moths in White.|It’s hard to speculate when we know so little about Ikoria as a plane, but I could easily see White being represented by a culture of monster hunters or tamers trying to eke our a foothold for civilization within the savage brutality of their world.
This is what it looks like in MTG Arena when you put 15 different types of counters on a creature.|Our players were so preoccupied with *whether* or not *they could*, they didn't stop to think *if they should*.
Channel Fireball and WotC: Can we get any sort of updates regarding upcoming MagicFests due to the Coronavirus?|There is an issue with testing for the virus in the US for the time being. Only certain labs are “authorized” to test COVID-19.   People who are monitoring the situation have no clue what’s going on because the authorities on the subject are tight lipped.   In other words, you won’t get an official word until the very last minute. Official word will be vague.  If anyone at WotC or CFB know anything, it’s only because they know a guy who knows a guy. They are just in the dark as the general population.
Cardmarket Series Seville and CM Bologna cancelled|I know its sucks but lets be honest its a good call. The sooner we get rid of COVID, the sooner we can get back to our favourite game.
Chains of Mephistopheles “Flow Chart” Alter by u/Neurommancer|From now on, to me, this is the real card text. Change Oracle now.
Found my old Magic: The Gathering Arena Disc.|Loved the card list of the entire 7th edition set. Used to spend hours just browsing through it and reading the flavor text.
Every card in the game has at least one A somewhere in its text, between name, typeline, and rules text.|Does this count?  https://6d4be195623157e28848-7697ece4918e0a73861de0eb37d08968.ssl.cf1.rackcdn.com/181716_200w.jpg
"""Welcome to Perfection"" (Sheoldred fan art)"|Hey everyone this is my fan art of Sheoldred :)  I've already done 4 of the 5 Praetors and plan to do the last one sometime next month. Here is my previous work :)   Vorniclex: https://www.instagram.com/p/B4p1sx5DbdS/?utm_source=ig_web_copy_link  Elesh Norn: https://www.instagram.com/p/B1we6ECjyXq/?utm_source=ig_web_copy_link  Jin-Gitaxias: https://www.instagram.com/p/B0RdHndgF8S/?utm_source=ig_web_copy_link  I hope you guys enjoy my work! Higher rez versions (Thanks instagram) can be found on my art station.   https://www.artstation.com/michaelbalzano
What was the reaction to the release of Laboratory Maniac?|People were making a lot of shitty decks based around labman in standard.
Magic Untapped - Lemur vs. Lemure: The story of one of the biggest art mistakes in Magic History|I'm glad it happened, though. The art is adorable.
MagicFest Detroit set to proceed despite spread of COVID-19 in the city.|If you have elderly parents or immuno-compromised friends or family, you might want to skip this.  Better safe than sorry.
Veteran Magic players, what are some of the most annoying cards/combos/decks you ever played against?|I’ve been around for a while, and despite all the annoying combos I’ve had to sit through, the turn 3 prime time kills, and other things that make my usual turn 1 thoughtseize look silly, I still hate the old modern eggs deck from when modern was a young format.  If I wanted to watch a magic player play with themselves for 20 minutes and occasionally end in disappointment for all parties involved, I can find that on porn sites, because wew lad that deck was monotonous to watch attempt to go off, especially when the player wasn’t the fastest.
Magic: Legends hands-on impressions - The Verge|I'd like to get my hands on a box of Legends.  Wrong Legends?
This Week in Legacy: Freeze Tag!|Legacy has an ass load of counters and discards. Green gets one. Litterally one playable Defence after 20+ years. Veil is just fine in legacy.
Theros Beyond Death basic land arts?|You could buy the lands and scan them yourself probably.  Or if you want a bigger source, you would probably have to contact the artists.
Looking for a Dark Souls-Themed Cube|Someone made an entire custom DS set a few years ago. Honestly I remember not liking it very much, but it's out there. Edit: hollows of lordran
Custom tokens for my commander deck that I started to make with my cricut. Really excited and wanted to share|I see you’re planning on double dipping for the karma once you finish the token.
"Mark Rosewater wants to hear from Commander players, ""I’m curious to hear your thoughts on five color identity commanders. More, less, changed in some way? What would you like?"""|There are more options for 5 color commanders than abzan commanders
Did 'Leyline of Lightning' kill me or not ?|"Yes, ""whenever you cast a spell"" is what it says, when you *cast* the spell. It doesn't have to resolve. So yes, your opponent was able to pay extra and kill you."
Mystery Boosters for Sealed?|PAX Unplugged in Philly did sealed events. It was fun, but a slow bomby format.
What are the best materials to line a deck box with?|I think just making sure the plastic is smooth will be enough. Any material like felt would probably catch the edges of the sleeves and serve to limit the inside size of the deck box. If your nephew double sleeves at all you'll want as much room in the Deckbox as possible.
Suggestions on altering mono green deck list|the henge is the price it is for a reason. It instantly makes your deck better than most other things you could put in it.
A tattoo I got to remember a friend of mine who passed away, He bought me my copy of All Is Dust for no reason other than he wanted to. I miss you Kolby ❤️|Found the Thousand Sons player
Baltimore Stores?|Baltimore native here, Games and Stuff usually has a large crowd of commander players. MTG First is another store but they are more focused on constructed tournaments (Modern Legacy and Pioneer). Both stores are located in Glenn Bernie.
Mastery of the Unseen and Transform interaction|"DFCs have three ""faces"" in this case: face up, transformed, and face down. You can't manifest a DFC and have it come into play as the transformed card, even though when you physically turn it over to its back face like a manifest there's something there. The act of transforming and turning it face up for its mana cost are two separate things.  > Some older Magic sets feature double-faced cards, which have a Magic card face on each side rather than a Magic card face on one side and a Magic card back on the other. The rules for double-faced cards are changing slightly to account for the possibility that they are manifested. If a double-faced card is manifested, it will be put onto the battlefield face down. While face down, it can’t transform. If the front face of the card is a creature card, you can turn it face up by paying its mana cost. If you do, its front face will be up. A double-faced permanent on the battlefield still can’t be turned face down.  Mastery of the Unseen will only trigger when a face down DFC (that was manifested) is turned face up, and doesn't interact with transforming at all."
Is this explanation of the interaction between Sylvan Library and Chains of Mephistopheles still accurate?|is it because chains creates a replacement effect for draw -> discard (using 'instead') but the mill portion of chains is not a replacement effect (i.e. does not use 'instead') ?
Are all mtg cardbacks the same in tone or are there darker versions out there?|Differences between printers. Or in this case, it's impossible for ink used today to have exactly the same ratios of the component substances as years ago.
Cardkingdom battle decks.|"Having owned abt 20 of them and being a standard/modern player, i can whole heartedly say the decks are very fun to play and have strong themes built in.  They are not just random chaff thrown into a ""beginners"" deck. Each Battle deck is well constructed and playing through them you have a good idea of what each deck wants to do; whether it be summoning a horde of spiders or zombies, aggro, control or some random jank win condition, the decks are great!  The descriptions are geeat at giving you an idea of how the deck plays.  Do note that the decks are not always available, new decks rotate in and out depending on what card stocks they have available.  *edit: spider spawning, red menance, dino might are great fun and still available. You cant really go wrong with any of the decks though."
If I'm interested in historic, which of the older sets is most worth my pack purchase?|I'm a little unsure what you mean, but let me answer both of the questions I think you might be asking:  1) PAPER: Historic really doesn't exist in the paper game, and it doesn't have much of a paper following. The most similar format is the new breakout format Pioneer, which includes standard sets from Return to Ravnica and forward. I don't know enough about the format to pin down a single set that would be the most influential on the format, but for paper I'd always suggest buying singles and netdecking when trying to learn a new format rather than trying to get lucky with pack pulls. It's a bigger inital price tag, but much cheaper in the long run.  2) ARENA: At the moment, only Ixalan and forward are legal. Out of that pool of sets, I'd probably suggest War of the Spark as your best bet for value. Very soon, we'll be getting some remastered sets, starting with Amonkhet. Once those start rolling out, you have the choice of buying packs from new sets to get lots of new cards, or keep opening packs from the same set to maximize wildcards and vault progress. Keep an eye out for Kaladesh and Aether Revolt when they come out, as they had historically standard warping cards.
MTG Artists Attending Gen Con 2020 - As of March 2020|I'm looking forward to being at the show with my fellow mtg artists :-) Thanks for putting together this list.      BTW, That's not a name mix up about Tom Babbey. He's a bud of mine. He has done a few mtg cards even if he hasn't put them up on his website.
Rank #2 Mythic -- Need help getting a paper deck for GP Detroit|If you have the full amount of money for the cards/deck, why not just buy the cards instead of asking to borrow/rent?
Need help finding an old life counter I used to use 93/94 era|I have a bunch and use them literally every time I play, they are reaper life counters. They had ties with Scrye, and Scrye had some exclusive stuff with reaper. Mine don't have Cork, just all pewter I believe  They were still selling tons of them on ebay for 40 bucks until a few years ago, but now they are hard to get and I don't know why. I remember seeing pages when I got one for a friend that liked mine  My guess is the new age old school players found out about it and wanted them too?  There are modern ones made by ultra pro and others from what I hear, but Reaper is the OG
Ban List Fever: The Never Ending Discussion of What Should (and Should Not) Be Banned|"Something that was kind of glossed over in the article is the amount of time it takes for WotC to make bans. If they are going to be printing busted cards every set, but it takes 2 - 3 months for them to ban a card that is making a format bad, then by the time they get around to it, the next set has come out with the next busted card. It kind of keeps the formats perpetually miserable to play.      I have taken a huge step away from constructed play after they released that big article that essentially said ""we're going to keep doing this, so tough cookies."" It kind of made me realise that the goal is format churn, not format health, which is just not something I have any interest participating in. Lo' and behold, since that article, almost all the constructed formats have really felt less ""fun"" for lack of a better term. I realise that lots of people still find constructed formats enjoyable, but there are just so many groaner cards everywhere, all the time. I never felt like this before."
Slim deck box|it seems like it might be, they had a form you could fill out on their english site a few months ago to potentially get a free one as they are supposedly moving into the US market but nothing has popped up since. it is a real company that sells other board game stuff on amazon US but no deck boxes so far.
MTGO won't load|Sorry I turned off the Apple II the server is stored on, un-install and re-install and it should work now.
GP Detroit|"They could cancel it the day of if they wanted to.  Massachusetts is facing 70 cases because of a single attendee at a conference.  There's too much we don't know about where the virus may have avoided containment to say what the odds are of someone with the virus attending Magicfest Detroit, but I wouldn't blink if in two weeks, ""Detroit Outbreak Traced to Magic the Gathering Tournament,"" was a headline. Again, I can't say how likely that is, just that I wouldn't be surprised."
1v1 Commander rules, Starting Life|MTGO has had so many different rule variations for Commander, it's sort of unreliable. I would just follow whatever is on MtGCommander.net. Or just talk to your group and play with what feels right.
Two new books on amazon|I think the WotS one is news. The others have been posted before.
Noob giving a shout out - Glasgow|West End Games is my local store and I'll always recommend it to folk. Staff are great, you'll always feel welcomed and if you're lacking a deck for any of the constructed events there will always be someone able to lend you one so you can play. Especially for new folk as well that want to get into the game, just ask any of the staff or regulars and they will always be more than happy to help out
What Does COVID-19/Coronavirus Mean for Magic Players?|Without being too catty, I'm honestly not sure I trust some of the people at my FLGS. If I can smell you, I'm not going to stay for game 2.
What is the language of the card to the right?|Korean
Are we ever going back to Kamigawa?|Maro has recently elaborated on potential returns to previous planes and he specifically mentioned Kamigawa as a very unlikely one
So it is almost here ;)|As a new to MtG standard player would this benefit me?  LGS has them for $90 preorder.  The fiend in me wants to bust them open....bad!
31 year old noob|Welcome back friend. I was you two years ago. My suggestion is to find your local game store and talk to the owner. Most local game stores have free welcome decks that they give out to new players and will be willing to use them to teach you and your son how to play. That is how I got started with my son 2 years ago. It has been a real strong bonding experience for the two of us. Good luck and have fun.
Pauper players will go to the end of the Earth to demand an Oubliette reprint|Why is Gavin dressed like he's in the Barbershop Quartet? lol
Why are certain mechanic keywords not always used?|> to avoid confusion (particularly for new players) as it was in a set that didn’t have other Surveil cards  Pretty much this. Only evergreen mechanics can be used freely in any set. The rest are either a featured mechanic or not used at all.
What happens when you put Containment Priest into play with opponents show and tell ability?|next time, start with the gatherer rulings  >If Containment Priest enters the battlefield at the same time as other creatures, its ability won’t affect those creatures.
Where to start?|It depends on the format.  If you want Standard, you can get a Challenger precon deck, which are released once a year, around April. The deck will be Standard legal until the Fall rotation, because they will contain cards from RNA, GRN, WAR and M20.  Other than that, your best bet is to look for a decklist online, price out the cards, and if in your budget, buy the cards via the secondary market.
Does anyone have an ultimate guard smarthive? If you do is it worth it?|I own a couple of them which double as transportation and storage.    I found it to be sturdy, durable and overall quite happy with it.    Magnets are working fine, fits 5 100+ decks with ease with a bit of breathing room so they are not stuck.  I have used different deck boxes, but since they are acting as storage, I opted for ultra pro or ultimate guard regular 100+ boxes (no boulders, no satin towers, etc) to store at least those 5.
So you run out TP, which card do you use?|That junk cards that just double sided advertisements
Reviews for Magic sets limited formats|The Limited Resources Podcast does exactly this for both sealed and draft for every new set.
Desparate Gambit question|Always look at the Oracle text of a card, especially for cards that are two decades old.  The first thing you do as the spell resolves is choose the source.  >Choose a source you control and flip a coin. If you win the flip, the next time that source would deal damage this turn, it deals double that damage instead. If you lose the flip, the next time it would deal damage this turn, prevent that damage.
What is the most damage that can be done by Pygmy giant?|"If you allow words to represent numbers, then there are a few cards that say ""million"" in the flavor text.   If you follow the above, and allow ""Infinite"" to be a number, then there are ten creatures Pygmy Giant should be chucking:   https://scryfall.com/search?as=grid&order=name&q=type%3Acreature+flavor%3AInfinite"
The Trouble with Cyclonic Rift in Commander - Hipsters of the Coast|I think I'd rather waste my energy complaining about bs lazily designed commanders like chulaine instead
In what way would one go about crafting Rakdos Burn|Fyi burn decks should be quick with cheap efficient spells, and really shouldn't be packed with big x spells since you're running less lands for a low curve and expected to win quickly.
3 Wizards Probability Riddle|Yep! I've linked to this videos more than any other on this subreddit (and r/EDH)
An easy way to learn for me?? 🙋‍♀️|Arena is a great way to learn Magic right now
Question about Archetype of Endurance|Nope, it either has hexproof as an object or it doesn't. Sometimes it might have hexproof from a certain thing(hexproof from black) but it's a rare example.
help with a transformation tribal commander|As far as I recall there's no legendary creature that benefits transform/flip/meld creatures directly. I suggest you either take a commander that:  \- fits your colour requirement and provides some sort of card advantage (Yidris maybe?)   \- or maybe one that allows to blink or flicker your creatures, as a way to reset them to their normal face side. Can't think of one with 4-5 colours right now, though.   Also consider the Kamigawa flip creatures, if they fit your theme.
What amount of information should I give to my opponent in paper game?|"That's entirely up to you. For that scenario, you're not obligated to tell them anything. If this were in a competitive event, knowing the rules is part of the game and you should have an edge for knowing that rule about protection if your opponent doesn't. If it's a casual game, I'd generally tell my opponent or let them take back a block because I'd care more about the game being fun and being played ""correctly"".  EDIT: In the situation you described of Stomp-ing their face pre-combat and then attacking, I would prefer to attack and if they blocked with the Drake then I would cast Stomp at their face and not allow a take back even in a casual game. But if it were a spot where I cast Stomp pre-combat to clear out a blocker or because they had Teferi, Time Raveler or something then I'd play it as I said above."
Looking for deck advice.|The fact that you ARENT running a full set of Cauldron Familiar and Witches Oven scares me....  But I like the deck!
What is the mechanic called when your creature does damage to another target?|It’s not keyworded. R&D uses Bite for this.
What decks typically run Cavalier Of Night?|I've seen the new Modern Yawgmoth combo deck run it. If you're a Commander type (and I'm not, so I'm open to being corrected) it could be good in anything devotion to black
Intelligent Beings in the Multiverse: What is the ratio of Magic:Non-Magic people?|I was under the impression that pretty much every creature in the multiverse is capable of manipulating mana, it's just a matter of know-how and innate talent.
Budget Magic: Hollow Herald (Modern)|The moment when he randomly discards and is left with only lands, and then the opponent plays Inquisition of Kozilek. Priceless. Probably one of the most fun decks I've seen.
Can anyone tell me what card this artwork is from? I hope this does not break rule 7.|REBECCA GUAY
Thalia Secret Lair goes live in 39 hours.|Damn, what set goes live in 6 days after this one hahah xD
Working on a few portfolio pieces specifically for MtG - First one is Grove Druid! Would this fit the MtG brand in your opinion?|MtG artist Kimonas Theodossiou helped me out by making up a mock brief for me. Curious to see if you think this fits the MtG brand and if you have any pointers!  Edit -  adding the mock brief here at the suggestion of another user:  **Art title:** Grove Druid   **Colour:** Green   **Action:** A female druid draws mana from the surrounding wilderness to charge up her reserves   **Focus:** The Druid   **Feeling:** at one with nature, she is ready for the trials ahead
Tips on my Atraxa Commander deck|/r/edh might be able to help you a lot better.
Choosing a new commander|I would build two budget decks, play them both then upgrade the one I like more.
Homura and copies|"Homura’s themed song is “Radioactive” by Imagine Dragons. (Sorry has to share)  Other comments have correctly answered your question but also  note flip cards are treated as the original portion of the card with a cmc while transform cards are treated only as the side facing up at the time they were copied and are unable to transform because you can’t physically flip them over face up/down:  ""If an effect copies a double-faced card, it copies the characteristics of whichever face is currently showing. It doesn't copy any characteristics of the other face” (source: Innistrad set release Notes )"
Veldalken orrery alter my friend made|Not gonna lie that looks really bad
LGS in London?|Bad Moon Cafe has a great casual vibe and is very central or Dark Sphere’s large and central. Have fun!
Bonding with step-son, any Magic advice ?|If you need to learn again, have him give you a refresher on the rules and basics. After that, maybe go to a draft, it could be really fun. Really cool that you’re doing this for him!
Get ready for Zenkaikonbat!|WTF is ZenKaiKon and why would I need a break from it?
Going to my first Grand Prix, any tips?|Shower and use hand sanitizer
Interaction between Teysa Karlov,Teysa Scion of Orzhov, Bishop of Wings and Divine Visitation|Yeah, it works that way. Don't forget you gain life too. Least if I remember the bishop correctly.
"""Level up"" Commander"|That'd be really cool. It would be kind of similar to the xp counter commanders except you lose all of your levels when your commander dies
Spark Double + Followed Steps with a Legendary Creature?|Yes, supertypes are a copiable value so this works fine
Need a little help remembering how your turn begins? Got you covered!|"I just repeated the mantra ""untap upkeep draw"" over and over in my head till it stuck.  I still repeat it in my head on my turn subconsciously."
How popular/active is Pauper?|100% depends on where you live and what you do about it.  I'm working to change the prevalence of Pauper in my community, but it's slow going.
Prisoner to magic.|What a weird picture.
Possible signs of Mystery Booster card distribution errors?|Only two of the slots care about frame. Demonic tutor is on one of the black c/u sheets.
What is the cheapest online store?|Usually tcgplayer
Are there any programs like cockatrice that still work?|https://untap.in/
Curses and Constellation|Yup. You control the curse despite it enchanting another player
Card Shops near Manassas Virginia?|I haven’t been in a year or so (most of my tabletop play is kitchen table casual and EDH with my kids), but the closest store is probably Comics & Gaming Outpost in Gainesville.   https://locator.wizards.com/event-reservations-web/store/7623  I’ve always had a good time when I’ve gone, if it hasn’t changed it’s a full mix of teens to middle aged with a positive, friendly atmosphere. AFAIK draft, standard, and modern all fire most FNMs. If you go on their Facebook page they are quick to answer questions. If you go East from Manassas instead of west there’s gonna be tons of stuff in the Fairfax area but I don’t have any experience at those stores.       Also ... I have lived in the Manassas area for about 15 years, this is definitely the first time I have heard someone say “I am going to Manassas, Virginia for Spring Break.” It’s a fine place to live, but not exactly a typical spring break destination. 😂
Question About Animar Commander|No, they cease to exist when he leaves the battlefield.  Edit: changed wording for rules clarity.
Red MTG Flavor Text|You sir are amazing
Free MTG Drafts for Kids - How I Share MTG with the Next Generation|Hey all - my wife and I have been volunteering for about 2 years at our local library to teach kids Magic.  TL;DW: Libraries have funds they can use to put on events for certain age groups/ranges. We saw another small tow library putting on free drafts for kids, so we approached ours about doing the same. It’s been a huge hit so trying to spread the word.
Back again with another 1920 X 1080 wallpaper. I was asked to make this, and they loved it. I hope you all like it as well.|Would you be able to put it in WUBRG order?
Unique Fun Events|Chaos drafts with a diverse pack pool are always bound to be exciting and unique. If you have a drafting crowd, maybe just getting some older boosters for exactly this purpose would be a good idea.

B.O.B. - Bevy of Beebles official playmat|Ah man bubbling beebles reminds me of my childhood. Deff picking it up
Newish, would like first deck advice|"Standard, and by extension Brawl, are the only formats that rotate.   In my experience new players rapidly grow out of actual ""new player product"" and that greatly reduces any value such an item has. I wouldn't recommend any planeswalker decks or spellslinger starter kit to anyone except children.  The Commander precons are actually a fine starting point if you have friends around already playing commander.  Last years commander decks are often still available at retail, one of the ones last year was Green/White/Red, and 2020 commander decks come out in April (and with five decks coming in april,chances are there will be one that interests you)"
Help! Trying to create something really beautiful but don't know where to start.|You could look at MTGcardsmith for both inspiration and an maybe rough draft your card so you know what you want it to look like.
In need of help with a side board guide.|Sideboarding is all about having answers available to help you in games 2 and 3, either to make the opponents deck not work as well, or to make yours work better).  While having the cards be within the theme of your deck (and there are bonuses to this in some cases) is a plus, it is more important that the overall effect hinders the main focus or win conditions of your opponents deck while sticking to your colors.  For example: if your deck is lacking fliers or reach, you want to add some fliers, reach, or things that destroy/damage them. Not drawing something that helps your combo go off? If you aren't running 4 in the deck have the extras in your sideboard. Got someone playing wide? Have some board wipes (ideally ones that only focus on your opponent or factors that won't hurt you). Someone milling you out? Have an answer in there that has you put your graveyard back, or pull from it. Someone who is dredging? Add something that exiles graveyards. All of these depend on the current meta game where you play, what colors you run, and what is available to you in both cost ($$$), cost (CMC), and legality.
"Question about ""May"" Abilities and the Stack."|"It's a triggered ability that goes onto the stack no matter what. You choose on resolution whether to draw a card.  Edit: rules reference  603.5. Some triggered abilities' effects are optional (they contain ""may,"" as in ""At the beginning of your upkeep, you may draw a card""). These abilities go on the stack when they trigger, regardless of whether their controller intends to exercise the ability's option or not. The choice is made when the ability resolves."
Commander oddity: White / Black only has 3 flying Commanders, and I find that to be very strange.|Boros has a bunch of angels, which probably explains why that is so high. Selesnya has a couple angels, maybe a few dragons?
Dear Wizards, will you please bring back...|2 nationals seem pointless when you multiple Grand Prix and Player Tours
Where to find Selesnya lore?|Maybe these two short stories?  https://magic.wizards.com/en/articles/archive/magic-story/bound-and-bonded-2018-11-14  And https://magic.wizards.com/en/articles/archive/magic-story/ledger-hidden-fortunes-2019-02-20
Looking for Cards that Change the Normal Game Rules/Flow|I actually did a recent video talking about decks exactly like that. Would you like a link?
So, odd question.|Do you remember around what set or time period you saw this card?
Which of the Enchantment Gods is least playable as a Commander and why?|To me, it's probably OG Heliod and Pharika.  Heliod is just so boring to me, and Pharika? Self-hating your GY in black feels so fuckin' weird man, I can't get over it. I know the reward can be pretty big, but fuck, I don't like it.
Help me crush groups my modern meta|You could always go with suicide black as well.  Out speed white weenies with dark rituals, and back it up with black's card draw and discard effects as well as creature control.  It was one of my favorite decks back in the day.

There’s a card which states an ability castable if the opposing player doesn’t let you see you play the card on the table which card is this?|Please consider https://translate.google.com/ for the title next time.
Nicol Bolas FanArt|I like the pose and colouring, but for me it has the same problem as many official WotC art pieces, which is that his face isn't really looking like a dragon. In the War of the Spark trailer and set they tried to get away from that and make him look like an actual dragon.
Semi-new player trying to get more into magic|I don't see the problem with Theros, has been a solid set so far.  &#x200B;  But how about heading to the next game shop and connecting with the local community. See what formats they play, maybe play a draft or an FNM and get a bit more into playing structured events. Or you might find some players running commander games and join them. And maybe there is some casual Modern going on and you can borrow a deck and play a bit before commiting to anything
God pack Lairs?|The FAQ says 6-10 weeks https://magic-support.wizards.com/hc/en-us/articles/360039262552-Secret-Lair-Theros-Stargazing-FAQ  A limited number are printed in advance and so get there earlier.
Any existing magazine / subscription existing for TCGs ?|I honestly can't think of any. Most of the popular ones I can think of (The Duelist, Scrye, Beckett) have all been discontinued.
Are there any good draft-type things you can do with 4 people?|You can always just draft. I do 4 person drafts all the time and it's fine. If you're worried about power level just do 4 packs instead of 3.
Standard Blue Devotion can do some silly things, had a great time crushing Bant!|Deck  4 Castle Vantress (ELD) 242  4 Opt (XLN) 65  17 Island (MIR) 336  3 Jace, Wielder of Mysteries (WAR) 54  4 Thassa's Oracle (THB) 73  4 Brazen Borrower (ELD) 39  3 Gadwick, the Wizened (ELD) 48  4 Nyx Lotus (THB) 235  1 Thassa, Deep-Dwelling (THB) 71  3 Thassa's Intervention (THB) 72  1 Blast Zone (WAR) 244  1 Mobilized District (WAR) 249  3 Sinister Sabotage (GRN) 54  1 Mystic Sanctuary (ELD) 247  1 Mass Manipulation (RNA) 42  3 Cavalier of Gales (M20) 52  2 Agent of Treachery (M20) 43  1 So Tiny (ELD) 64  &#x200B;  Sideboard  3 Aether Gust (M20) 42  3 Cerulean Drake (M20) 53  3 Mystical Dispute (ELD) 58  1 Sorcerous Spyglass (XLN) 248  2 Stonecoil Serpent (ELD) 235  2 Mass Manipulation (RNA) 42  1 Ugin, the Ineffable (WAR) 2
TCC Untitled Podcast: Should Commander/EDH Be Changed?|I watched the TCC episode with Shivam on how to keep commander casual, and I came away with a bad impression of Shivam.  Same result here with Olivia.  That's a 0/2 for the CAG.
Confusion regarding summoning sickness|>Apparently both of my friends have been able to do so on MTG online  Ask them to show you. Also, they should take a video and post it, because if it's true, it's a pretty significant bug!
Snow-Covered Wastes, inspired by a thread by u/HonorBasquiat|The original feeling I got that both snow-covered Plains and Swamps looked too much like Wastes is now reinforced looking at this.
MTG Deck: Multiplayer Mill Madness:|I'd always advise heading for Phenax, God of Deception, but then you end up with a completely different deck:  http://tappedout.net/mtg-decks/toughness-trilogy-ep-iii-the-wall-of-phenax/
Is there any Eldrazi Planeswalker Cards?|Long answer:  Actually, flavor wise, there is no real way for an eldrazi to become a planeswalker. The nature of a spark is that it awakens inside a living being, and it gives the new walker the ability to cross the multiverse via the blind eternities.   The eldrazi, of which we know little, are from the Blind Eternities. The titans we know are just a manifestation of a larger being, they are just what the being manifests as in the planes themselves. Since the Eldrazi can in some way already “navigate” the blind eternities, seems unlikely/not useful for them to even be capable of a spark. I guess eldrazi are “alive” in a sense, but they seem more akin to me to a mindless (and manaless) entity. I presume it is impossible for an eldrazi to spark.
Thassa's Intervention|"You can certainly cast it for X=0. It will then read ""Counter target spell unless its controller pays twice 0."" Which the controller will always be able to pay: 0."
Unsanctioned Inner Sleeves|should be fine  but prepare for some slippery cards
ideas for dealing with bans|That would never happen...
Theros Theme Boosters for Sealed|Each Theme booster is 35 cards that are playable within a single color (or combination of two colors, for the Guilds/Allegiance ones); theoretically, you could sleeve up a single Theme booster with 25 appropriately-colored basic lands and have decks right then and there.
ARENA IS GREATTTT|I mean, the claim you can farm enough free gold in a day to draft even once is demonstrably false, but glad you like it.
Anyone know where you could find poster prints of the Japanese art WAR Planeswalkers?|Looking around, it looks like there aren’t any official posters printed. The only things I could find were the stained glass wall scrolls, a few playmats and the cards themselves.  You could always try to find a high res version and get it printed yourself.
MTG Paper results analyzer|FYI Linux and Mac have .NET Core 3.1 distributions available, so if you retargeted this to be a Core console app it'd likely be able to build on those platforms.
Fellow Jund Players Help Me Out Please?|Why do you think Wrenn and Six is not good? Or better why do you think it's worse than Bob, which is the slot it's fighting for as a 2 mana card advantage engine
Best Commander from the Secret Lair|That's a difficult question to answer without knowing how and with what cards you will play the deck.  I think Narset is cheesy, it is pretty easy to put some savagely op cards in and play them off the top (taking extra turns is popular).  I think Meren has the most raw power, no matter how you build the deck her ability will be generating tons of value.
"""Target Player Reveals Their Hand..."""|While revealing a hand is a powerful effect, there is a pretty strong belief that hand attack such as Despise or Thoughtseize is one of Black's forms of hate. In the same vein, Counterspells are the way that Blue deals with hard to handle problems. But they both have their pros and cons.  One of them being proactive (hand attack) and the other reactive (counterspells). But a few differences make one seem less good. Thoughtseize can take anything, and it's cheaper than the good counterspells, but it can't take the top of the deck. While Counterspell can counter anything, but it costs one more mana.  Thoughtseize also looks at a hand and gives information, but Counterspell requires your opponent to spend mana and resources into the spell you are countering.  It's a form of balance between the colors and taking it away would make Black have less identity. They're already printing less of it or worse versions of it because players complain about it, but taking it away would move it closer to White (a color notorious for losing its identity recently).
The flavor of Cathartic Reunion...|"""Mom, I missed you so.""  ""Here's three stinkweed imps, daughter."""
Time to Break the Color Pie (more)!|"Ok, so this is just divvying up blue to other colors and saying ""fuck it?"" I guess that's...something."
Chances.|I assume you want the chance of opening Liliana, Dreadhorde General or Commence the Endgame?  Just buy singles. It is EXTREMELY unlikely that you will 'save money' buy opening booster packs when you are looking for specific rare or mythic. I think it is roughly 1/121 chance for a specific mythic and 2/121 chance for a specific rare.
Would the game be improved if every card had Cycling 2 baked in?|Variance isn't inherently bad, in fact in a lot of ways variance helps the game by helping make every game you play unique. If there's too much consistency all games will feel too samey
Trying out a new Talkshow format, Talking about the lack of a Pioneer ban!|Format is healthy, bans not necessary. 2019 levels of banning cards is not something that you want sustained and is bad for the game in general.
Polukranos unchained help|I don’t know fully what the deck would need, but as a connoisseur of janky decks turned viable I’m sure there is a way. I assume you want copies of Nyleas Forerunner as another trampled enabler, as well as multiple ways of fulfilling and returning things from your graveyard. I’d start with 4 x Tymaret calls the dead as well given the amount of enchantments the deck will likely have So as to get some scry in, and put in a Setesan champion to make it so the rest of those enchantments fuel a draw engine.
Blood Moon Discord|hope that this is a joke post?
Secret Lair experiences - from order to arrival|Still waiting on my Theros lair to ship
Commission made by my friend of me and my partner as Vivien and Jace. Twitter: @WHISPEY|I'm in love with the concept of an MTG deck cushion.  Now I'm itching to get one made in real life, with that liney texture on the side and everything.  Adorable!
Has Covid19/Coronavirus impacted your LGS?|My LGS just tells people not to come in if they’re sick. Not in good health, not allowed to draft.
Kaya’s Ghostform|When a permanent leaves the battlefield and returns, it's considered a new game object. So all counters and other effects on the original permanent won't apply anymore.     If there is an X in the casting cost, as the card was not cast, X is undefined which is handled as 0. So you would get a 0/1 Hydra and the option to choose between double counters or fight as an etb trigger.
Much Abrew: Mr. Toad's Heartless Summoning (Modern)|🦀 ONCE UPON A TIME 🦀
Has a Limited format ever had a card ban?|"In formats that could conceivably have ante cards (like if you wanted to run Ice Age-Alliances-Coldsnap draft, with Amulet of Quoz being a possibility in the first round), those cards are banned. At various times in history, the rectification mechanism for that case has been ""Call the judge and show them the ante card in your pack, then they take it away and replace it with a random card from the same set and rarity"" or ""Too bad, guess someone gets stuck with a worthless 15th (or 8th) pick.""  Drafting didn't really take off as a format until Mirage, so all such cards predate that and the issue only came up when people were trying to do ""retro"" or ""wacky"" drafts."

Why doesnt Wizards reprint a lot more lands?|Keeping them scarce allows them to essentially print money every few years.
Do you like having set/block villains (Oko), immediate threats (Eldrazi), or the mastermind (Bolas)?|What matters is how they are implemented, all can be good. And if you want to extend this to a set/block's conflict, there are examples of the state of the world being the conflict, like how Time Spiral was about a pending apocalypse that could only be averted by Planeswalkers sacrificing their sparks, or how Return to Ravnica, despite have villains causing problems, was about overcoming the maze system set up by the absentee Azor before it destroyed all the guilds.
New edh deck and I need your opinion on it|Seems solid and fun. If you want to upgrade I'd focus  on the mana base first.
I really miss Game Day playmats|They also got rid of Game Day, which was the main event for giving out Champion playmats, which doesn’t bode well for a return of champion playmats, sadly.   I’d love those playmats to return. I loved the possibility of winning one of those every game day. I only ended up getting one, but it was the Ixalan map one, and I love it so much i have it in a playmat top loader and I’m gonna mount it on my wall.
Rules Question: Nissa, Who Shakes the World and Arixmethes, the Slumbering Isle.|Arixmethes enters the Battlefield with Slumbers counters; It's a Legendary Land.  After Nissa animates Arixmethes, and it has Slumber counters; It's a Legendary Land Creature - Elemental, gains Vigilance and Haste, is a 0/0 with three +1/+1 counters.  After the last Slumber counter is removed from the animated Arixmethes; It's a Legendary Creature - Kracken Elemental, gains Vigilance and Haste, is a 0/0 with three +1/+1 counters.
Old tutorial pc game?|If I'm correct I think it was there was a 7th edition 2 player deck thing that came with the CD. Look it up on amazon. It has Thorn elemental on the cover.
Can someone explain the flavor text on the RTR version of Pithing Needle?|Rakdos festivals are bloody spectacles of torture and death, often pulling both Rakdos Cultist and innocent bystanders into the show (many of whom never exit alive)   So I'd assume that those who seek the Pithing Needle before are those fearing the prospect of a torturous death within the Rakdos Carnarium; and those who seek it afterwards are the ones who are overwhelmed by the guilt of the various acts they witnessed, committed, or otherwise revelled in.
Booster draft best way to play casual?|Use Magic Arena, it's against Bots but it's by far the easiest way to draft without investing a lot of money
Angrath + Heliod|Angrath doesn't care if it's still a creature or not, so you sacrifice it still.
What are some alternate game types you like to play besides standard, modern, pioneer, commander, etc.?|I'm a big fan of pack wars, you open a pack without looking at the cards, take out the token and the basic land, then shuffle in 3 of each basic land. Then draw 7 cards, no mulligans, and play Magic! It's my favorite way to open packs.

Creating pauper/peasant deck for beginners and game night. Any advices?|I think it’s best if you create those decks to be played against each other, which should remove any balance or format worries. Essentially, you’re creating budget pioneer decks, which is fine. If someone likes their deck, they can always upgrade.
Why isn't FlashHulk a deck in Legacy/Vintsge|Flash isn't a deck in Legacy because Flash is banned in Legacy, they had one tournament of that deck and decided to never let it be a thing again.  Vintage, similarly, has the card restricted.

Can someone explain a ruling on Lorthos/Breaching Leviathan for me?|It's plural because you could tap creatures controlled by different players. Each player would not untap the affected creatures on their next untap step(singular), but as there are multiple players affected, there are also multiple untap steps(plural) affected
Best use for old bulk?|If you’re a DnD player, you can cut them up and use the arts to make creature tokens. Way cheaper than buying minis and way more fun too.

How exactly do planeswalker sparks/ignitions work?|1. Not everyone is born with a spark.  In general only organic, sapient life can be born with a spark, though sparks have been transferred.   2. The only people who can ignite a spark are those who are born with it.  Circumstances vary, but it usually involves an event that causes an extreme emotion in a person, such as a near-death experience or a particularly horrible trauma, but it's not always negative (Samut).   3.  There have been moments in canon where planeswalkers have lost their sparks, either willingly (Venser giving his spark to Karn before dying) or by force (Bolas in War of the Spark)

Artist profile of Chris Rahn|Hi all, I've put together a profile of Magic artist Chris Rahn, who has illustrated many of my favourite cards, I hope you enjoy it.
Still cant believe Uro.|I need you to understand that A) ramping is good, especially on turn 2 or 3, and B) that a 6/6 for 4 mana that you didn't pay a card from hand for is always a great rate, and this one casts a free growth spiral.
MTG Storage|Except for aesthetics, is there any functional difference between your solution and stacking two 4 row boxes per square in the kallax ?
When 'Undead Alchemist' attacks a Planeswalker and isn't blocked, are loyalty counters removed or cards milled?|Planeswalkers aren't players. A creature that attacks a planeswalker generally won't be dealing any damage to a player. The alchemist's ability only cares about damage to players.
Newbie feeling overwhelmed getting started|You need to download and start with magic arena. It will teach you everything you need to know about the game in terms of keywords and how interactions play out. It starts limited but you get s decent amount of free cards and decks to work with. If you enjoy arena I would then buy the latest booster box at the lgs and start your collection. Yes booster boxes are not always worth the money in terms of what you get but I enjoy filling my binder with all the cards in the set. I also find looking through an organized binder makes it easier when making a deck as you have clear view of the cards thst are available to you. When you have a deck in mind make it with the cards you have and buy singles to fill in the gaps.  You will feel overwhelmed in the begining but once your around for a few sets and your cards start adding up you'll be in just a good as a position  as everyone else for Friday night magic or whatever your playing.  I recently started as well, theros is my third set in and this is how me and my friends got into it.

The Future of Pioneer|Pioneer is WOTC's format. They wouldn't give control to anyone else.  They use actual tournament results, MTGO and Arena data, etc to determine their bans. If Cat combo and Inverter decks aren't taking over the metagame, then there's no reason to ban them. They see the data - we don't.

Best tribes for each two color combo?|Just a note, if you’re gonna make a tribal cube, you want to make sure you have overlap between tribes. Having some creatures that work in multiple tribal decks (like a Human Ninja working in Human and Ninja decks, for example,) makes the draft flow much better.
Sol ring alter (Phyrexian style)|Monster energy style

new card idea|>tap 2 search your library for 3 beasts add them to your hand and give them flying  This does not work because it's not Hearthstone. You can't give abilities to creatures in your hand because it's a hidden zone.  Edit: You can't give creatures *static* abilities when they are in your hand. You can give them activated abilities, but it would have to be a continuous effect in play, not a one shot.

What makes a pack or card exciting?|Certain cards can make an archetype viable are more important than drafting filler cards.

Good deck recommendations for a new format my locals is doing.|You could probably start with a pauper deck like mono green infect or mono white heroic, and upgrade it a bit. Or just use the pauper list itself, because pauper decks are surprisingly strong
Using Scryfall API on Google Sheets|I know this is just a tiny script.  But if it grows, and it will.  Make a variable at the top for your https web address and just make a call to that variable.  It will save you in the long run if this grows.  Im sure you have already did this, it's just one of my trigger points seeing urls in code
X-Ray Glasses of Urza|Seems super powerful - as whenever it appears you get to see their entire deck; don't people scoop sometimes to *deny* players the ability to look through their deck?  I suspect this would be disliked in constructed.  In limited having the information is useful but probably less so than constructed (it's not like they can sideboard massively game 2/3 of a limited set).  The not shuffling makes it off the scale too - knowing all their future draws. I don't see why you wouldn't say 'shuffle afterwards'.  Maybe make it tap and sac too, since you only need to look through the library once.  It would also slow the game down as the player would want to write down the full list of cards...so I don't see it being designed soon ;)
Can someone make a mono blue sea god tribal deck for me?|Most likely, removing the serpent and the bests the sea god makes your deck better. If you have the playset of the borrowerr you can have a pretty decent tempo deck. Look at the simic flash lists and try to use the better blue cards only.
Best way to carry around multiple satin towers?|Best way to carry the decks would be to put them in something else.   Satin Towers are great for carrying a single deck but very clunky and inefficient if you are carrying multiple.

Can someone explain me why cyclonic rift is not banned from EDH ?|Because it costs 7 mana and is not uncounterable. If it resolves without interaction its the fault of the pod, not the player
A 3D printed deck box I designed.|Whats about sleeved cards?
Heya, I used to play about 3-4 years ago. Around Nashville GP time and a few months past it. I quit because the game was becoming ludicrously expensive to keep up with. (Kid Jace came out and was a 120 USD...) so I quit. How is the ecosystem now? Still ridiculous for competitive decks?|Play eternal formats or play standard on Arena. Playing paper standard is a giant waste of effort time and money.
Thaumaturge + Bronzehide Aura|Bronzehide aura doesn't remove abilities of the enchanted creature, it makes bronzehide aura lose all of its other abilities. It does this so you can't make the aura itself indestructible.  If you put an enchantment on the thaumaturge that makes it lose abilities, those abilities won't trigger. The aura is in play before the ability would go on the stack.

Rule of law question|Thanks leagcy and every one else who responded. I understand now and appreciate the help.
Why does CFB shuffle Mystery booster packs from different boxes during MagicFest?|"Also, in the quote it says you ""could"" fill an eight person draft without duplicates, but not that a box will provide that. I guess its more like marketing speech, trying to illustrate the great number of cards in this set."
Those who have had MTG cards survive a fire, I need a little help.|I'm not sure about cards specifically, but can you get an ozone treatment?  It works for books, and I'm not sure why cards would be different if it's just a smell.
MTG formats with very small decks? (12 or 15 or something?)|My son and i play Pack Wars and sometimes we have friends over too.  The idea is each player gets one booster pack and 15 lands, 3 of each. They open the pack and shuffle the lands and cards together then play the packs against each other.   It’s a small format but it’s really fun and an exciting way to play cards that would otherwise just be thrown into boxes for perpetuity.
Is there a good store in PCola area to go play FNM?|Both TBS and Price Busters have FNM.  Check em both out and go for the one you like most!
Tribal Wars (Kitchen table)|I think this article is pretty much perfect for you: https://www.mtggoldfish.com/articles/thirty-casual-modern-decks-under-20-for-magic-the-gathering-tribal-edition
Will Ikoria be standard legal at Players Tour Houston? Why release the set the same day the tournament starts?|My guess would be that PTs have lost some of their charm since Arena came out. Thanks to Arena early release and the huge amount of online tourneys (Twitch rivals etc) available these days we often know the best deck within weeks of release.   By having the PT be the same weekend as release it makes things a lot more wild and exciting.   My concern would be the availability of cards however. I know that dealers can’t sell cards before release, meaning it’ll be a mad dash for players on the day. Unless Wizards plan to give out singles to participants.
What elements of LotR would you consider blue magic?|Definitely the part where Gandalf mills Sauruman to deaath.   Ok really there's just not much magic in LotR, maybe the blue aspect of Gandalf would be his wisdom, knowledge, research of the ring, and so on.
Looking for the funniest black border magic cards for an Un-cube.|Toss in some ante cards and have it be for the duration of the cube. Like if you snag a card from someone due to ante, you can add it to your deck for the duration of the cube and the opponent has to move a card from their sideboard to it. Not terrible consider you have a good chance of the ante card being a land.  Fodder cannon is pretty funny flavor wise.

Urza, the Lorekeeper|You’d have to put in “You May choose not to untap ~ during your untap step”  Also Any permanent might be too powerful with that cost. Maybe “2: remove one counter from a permanent you control”  His casting cost should probably be at least 2UU, and I’m assuming his special thing should cost WUBRG?  Edit: what’s his p/t? 2/2 or 1/3 maybe?
Not a common strategy, but quite efficient in standard.|"starting a video with ""its'a boi"" should be a crime"
Noob Question about Rakdos Carnarium|Lands tap for mana, not for actual lands. It taps for one of each color, so one Black mana and one Red mana.
Question about selling cards on cardmarket.com|You get 14,60. And then you should refund the buyer the sipping cost.
Act of treason with Nightmare Shepherd?|You controlled it when it died, so the Shepherd's ability will trigger. And you'll be able to exile it from your opponent's graveyard when the trigger resolves to create a token copy of it.
Question Regarding Nightmare Shepard and Commander|"I'm pretty sure you can, although the timing is a little important.  You can return your commander to the command zone whenever it would go to a zone other than the command zone and the battlefield. So what you have to do is let your commander go to the graveyard (don't put it in the command zone yet, or it won't ""die""), then Nightmare Shepard triggers and lets you exile your commander to create a token. Do that, and once your commander would be exiled by the ability, you can choose to put it in the command zone instead, and Nightmare Shepard's ability still works (I think, I'm not 100%, but I think the second half of its ability checks for whether you make it move towards exile, not whether it ends up there, or something like that)."
I made a low-poly elesh norn in blender!|Hey look, they put Elesh Norn in Oldschool RuneScape.
How are MTG cards produced and packed?|It is mechanical. Thats shy they are able to change up the distibutions between sets. Its all done at the printers.
Commander with just Commins and Uncommons|It sounds similar to Pauper Commander, maybe check that out :)
Odds of Arcane Signet and Sol Ring Reprint?|Sol Ring: 100%   Arcane Signet probably has a decent chance, but I wouldn't bet on it either. Maybe they have Brawl decks in mind for the future, maybe something else, who knows. Not really a precedent for it.
Definitive Guide to Pioneer Spirits: One CMC Spells|It's always baffled me a little that Permeating Mass never gets picked up on tbh. In a tribe that has access to lords, it seems like a solid way to ensure you win any creature race you need to.
A custom Grixis commander inspired by a friend's D&D character|"""You lose life equal to its mana cost"" would imply that if you gained control of a Coiling Oracle, for instance, you would have to lose ""Blue Green"" life.  ""Blue Green"" is not a number.  I suspect you mean ""converted mana cost"".  Also this is kind-of busted.  A respectable hasty body with a one-sided Rakdos the Showstopper ability every turn?  And it can steal any nonland permanent?  At instant speed?  The turn it comes down?"
Unblockable and protection from color|Protection prevents four things (DEBT)  **D**amage from the source   **E**nchanting/Equipping by the source   **B**locking by the source   **T**argeting by the source  So while a pro-blue creature can't be blocked by Invisible Stalker, it does not allow them to block Invisible Stalker.
Ban list|The update is tomorrow. You could have Googled this.
Wastes??|Wastes are a basic land. Anything that searches for a basic land can search for it. You can also have any number of wastes in your deck as long as they are legal in the format you want to play them in.

Limited Level-Ups 16: THB Under/Overrated Cards and How to Keep Winning Late into a Format|Hey all!  This week we discuss ways that we keep our win-rate up deep into a format, especially when the rest of the field has become proficient at playing the format.

Help me find some ugly basic lands|Half-art Zendikars are probably the most tilting lands to see across the table
Need advice on a good table/chair setup for mtg/board game nights|Sofa's kind of suck for playing cards. You are reclined so you have to sit on the edge of it or be too far away to reach the table. A dining room table or a card table with folding chairs work perfect.
What happens if you reach max hand size, and cannot play anything else from your hand?|At seven, nothing.      At any number greater than seven(or whatever your maximum handsize currently is), you need to discard to seven at the end of your turn.

Long term storage outside the home - Rented storage unit|If it is really that valuable of a collection, I'd find a way to *not* have to store it in a storage unit.
Shortest Rules Text|"Relentless Advance wins on character count.  For theoretical cards, ""Scry 1"" would be the fewest possible characters, while ""Populate"" or ""Proliferate"" would be the fewest possible words on a single instant or sorcery that's still a functional card. ""Epic"" is the fewest characters for a useless card that'd technically be legal.  My favourite is Time Stop, for having only 3 words that apply to so many different game mechanics."
Where to start with magic lore?|The story is hit and miss. The serial/anthology short stories from Eldritch moon and Amonkhet blocks were actually pretty good having already gained some familiarity with the characters and big bads. But the full collection of lore has so many different authors, formats, and inteded audiences that everyone is bound to find stuff they like and stuff they don't.  Honestly, the best part of the magic lore is the worldbuilding, and the best vehicle for that is the game itself. Learn about the color pie if you haven't already, as that's arguably what makes magic _magic_, both from a gameplay and a lore perspective.  Also, obligatory https://mtgretold.tumblr.com
Can Thing in the Ice make a comeback in Pioneer?|Thing is just one of those cards that waxes and wanes often.  It’s definitely good enough to see play with the right support, a lot of it just depends on the surrounding meta and what tools are available to it.
Yarok and Woodland Bellower synergies|being limited to green is the real kick in the nuts here. there's really not much degeneracy to be had. there's plenty of value options (wall of blossoms, rec sage/manglehorn, eternal witness, fierce empath) and it's only a matter of time before they print the missing piece.   that being said for 6 mama I don't think it's currently worth running in yarok
Killing Indestructible Creature with Mixed Effects?|Damage does not reduce toughness. A 6/6 that's dealt 4 damage is not a 6/2. It's a 6/6 with 4 damage marked on it.  If you give a 6/6 creature -3/-3, it's now a 3/3. A 3/3 indestructible creature with lethal damage marked on it is not destroyed, because it has indestructible.

Human Drafting App in Arena - Call-Out for Participants|Hm, is it possible to build a deck for direct challenge with only 40 cards and 5+ duplicates?
ETB or lenged rule. Which first?|Roalesk enters, the triggering its ability.  Then, the SBA are checked and, you choose one Roalesk and put the other into the Graveyard, triggering its ability.  Then, the two triggers are put on the Stack in the order of their controller's choice.  You can put the Dies trigger on the Stack first, then the ETB trigger. So, you add the counters to the target, then Proliferate them.
Game group app|There was a guy a couple of years ago had that idea it didnt take off.
Torban + Embercleave = 38 points of dmg on turn 5... why is this in the game?|That’s with a nut draw and you not packing interaction.  Build your deck better.
Transparent glass altered card.|The realistic blood smudges on the text box really bring this piece together.   There is no doubt in my mind when handling this card that I need to be careful.
Clarification on card mechanic|The counters would be put into Voldaren Pariah before it flips *BUT* it would still keep them after it flips because it's still the same object on the battlefield. It's not leaving or entering the battlefield, it's just changing states.
Yarok zombie commander|Presumably, you'd want to search for Zombie cards and tribal cards with ETB triggers?

Just got into magic|It must attack each turn. That’s it.
New player trying to make his first deck|Korvold is a great build-around commander for sacrifice synergies.  Look into edhrec.com for help on most played cards.
Double Strike when blocking|I think you're misunderstanding how double strike works. It's not that there's an additional phase of combat where the creature can re attack and re block but more that it attacks and blocks the same as everything else but then it does damage both when creatures with first strike deal damage, and when normal creatures deal damage. So unless the creature blocking your double striker had first strike then your double striker would live since it deals its damage and kills your opponents creature before they deal their damage. But since the blocked creature is dead there's nothing to assign damage to for the second hit so nothing happens there.
Any good LGS in Genève?|There is a small one near your hotel. It’s called “l’epee à 2 nains” or something similar to that. I passed by there once and it looked really nice but I haven’t had the chance/time to play there yet.  I have not been able to find any other LGSs in Geneva, I read about another one, but have not yet gone to check it out.  I am interested as well if people have other recommendations.

Garage Sales|The days of oblivious parents selling off their kid's collection are long gone, the best deal I've found at a garage sale recently was a $15 Thoughtseize. Back in the 90's though, some friends and I split a box that we found at a garage sale, it was a typical 800 count box, taped shut, but the guy swore there was good stuff in it, it cost us $125. We took it home and decided to just take turns pulling cards and deal with any imbalance once we knew what was in it. The first card was a Mox Sapphire. At the end of it there were four moxes, six duals, and about 20 other cards that were worth between $10 and $50. Those were the days.
Arcane Adaptation|You only get to name one type.
Gary is comin for ya|Looks like his tit is out tbh
Should MtG return to a spell-focused gameplay instead of the current creature craze?|Noncreature spells are doing fine.  The World Championship was won by a control deck with 2 creatures in it.  One of the best decks in Pioneer has 7 or 8 creatures in it, all combo pieces.  If you don’t want to play a creature-focused deck, you don’t have to.

Y'all ninjas wanna play some edh?|What does the title mean?  Do people have to play Ninja decks?
Is this game with getting into now??|The game is more popular now that it ever has been. Bear in mind in the winter usually people play less, so things are starting to pick up now as we move into spring and summer.  Now is not only a great time to start, but perhaps the best time to start.
MTGO has really been upping its game recently with the Draft notifications.|"Pretty sure his real last words were ""Make sure to abuse this card in pauper, it is just begging to be exploited with mystic sanctuary"". Obviously that's what everyone must think he said."
Noob Question - Instant Priority|last in, first out. the giant growth goes off first, then your 4 damage instant. the ceratops survives. that's why it's most advantageous to cast your spells at the last possible moment.
Just confused about a rule|Braid is a very... unique card.  The cumulative upkeep is actually you gaining mana that can only be used on your upkeep, there is not cost to be paid by the player like normal upkeep cards.
To those with MTG tattoos; Do you have any regrets after a few years have gone by?|About tattoos in general, my experience:   If its not badly drawn, the most that could happen is forgetting about them until you look in the mirror.
Have you ever gained 61561195027157310796674288400204717 life in a single hit?|You have your math off quite a bit - Thromok gives you the square of the number of creatures he devours. In this case, he would get 26^2 counters, which is 676. Quite a large number of counters, but no where close to what you describe.
Brawl decks prices on cardmarket|The deck prices aren't based around how strong they are, but how desirable they are. It's definitely related, but there's not going to be a 1:1 correlation between price and general strength level of each deck.
New player|There is no guarantee you will get enough cards you like from a booster box to build a complete deck. Boxes are intended for draft, not dumping it out to make a constructed deck.  Planeswalker decks are *okay* for beginners but tend to be quite underpowered and new players grow out of them too quickly.  When April rolls around I'd recommend a Challenger deck, they have much more exciting cards than a planeswalker deck and represent budget versions of real competitive decks.
Like traditional constructed, commander would make more sense if it maintained multiple formats (i.e. modern, pioneer, legacy) to better control power level and ban lists and possibly rules.|We have that, and it's called Brawl, and it's pretty much a flop
Subreddit for standard?|/r/spikes is pretty good
Scooping Etiquette|I think it would have been fine to scoop on your turn if there's limited time and you think you can join another game.  I know in my playgroup, I've scooped with another player to get a side game in when it looks like the other two players are going to take another 30 minutes.
First time getting 40 MOCS qualifier points. MTGO Tournament starts in 40 hours. Need advice.|I'm assuming you're talking about the Modern PTQ on Sunday the 8th (in the US), since that's the only event you can enter with QPs this week, aside from the other PTQ.  >Do I need to be queued and ready before then?  You need to be in the event before it starts.  Whether that's now or 5 minutes before the event, that's up to you.  >How automated is it?  You'll play some number of rounds of swiss based on the tournament attendance, then it cuts to top 8.  The system handles it all.  >Is there downtime between matches like a real tournament?  Yes, because it's swiss rounds instead of random pairings like leagues.  >How many rounds should I expect?  Probably 7 or 8.  >If I look at the last MOCS results can I tune my SB to that meta?  The Modern showcase was last weekend, so the top 32 should be fairly indicative of the current metagame.
What cards would you like to see in Secret Lair?|I don't know why people think Secret Lair Fetches might happen. Why would WOTC let people buy them direct when they could drive sales for an entire set (probably supplemental). I get that people would want them, but it's a waste from their perspective.  Personally, I'd like to see a Secret Lair for equipment. Get some cool new art for a Sword or two and maybe Greaves or Darksteel Plate.
Inconsistent wording for library search effects.|They're functionally identical, chances are it's just something that got missed when designing the cards. Usually effects are templated in pretty standard ways, these are 99% identical so it might have just slipped through by mistake.  Either that or between Bauble originally being printed and Landscape being printed, they updated how they template that effect, but didn't seem it important enough to errata older cards.

Help with balancing our playgroup|They said they can't build decks with the budget you asked for, 75, but they really should be able to. Raise your asked budget a bit, and negotiate.   The command zone podcast discusses power levels and balance in a playgroup often. I reccomend giving them a listen
"I convinced some coworkers to start a ""format"", what to buy?"|Go to CardKingdom.com and buy a Battle Deck for each person. They are inexpensive at $9.99 each, balanced to play against each other, and they have a whole lot of different decks to choose from. If you are in America you can get them within a week of ordering and shipping isnt that expensive.

What's so good/ expensive about Goblin Rabblemaster?|Rabblemaster, left unanswered, will kill people scary fast. The damage bonus it gets from other goblins scales like none other.
Help balancing playgroup|"Well, making special rules for one another's decks isn't exactly great; however, it sounds like your friend group is experiencing something in Magic that casual groups deal with all the time called ""the Arms Race"".  Essentially, because the wider pools some of you have, you are a disadvantage. My best recommendation is to do this:  1.) Have all players use cards from a certain period and up. Perhaps try something like Standard's cut off or Pioneers. 2.) Players whom have less cards naturally need help. If your all good friends, perhaps try trading what you have to a friend to get some upgrades from their card pool; if you can't, try asking politely if you may use the card for a bit until you can get your own copy. If you do this, be a real friend and return the card(s) when you are done playing. 3.) For a while, my group enforced a single-ton policy. This made sure no one had more than a single copy of any given card; sure you can have your mythics and rares, but only one of each. And that makes it generally harder to be beaten by said cards.  Either way, I can give more ideas, but your situation is a precarious one. It only takes friends getting mad over a card game to ruin friendships altogether."
Should Wizards integrate the player (and game) into the lore?|"This works very well in video games and very poorly in literature, with rare exceptions.  I adore writing and reading second person but most people do not, and it's by far the hardest POV to pull off.  ""Choose-your-own-adventure"" also lends itself to kitsch, not good storytelling, and you're never going to make everyone happy."

Steps after FNM|You should not necessarily move to another format but to more important events. Play a Players Tour Qualifier, travel to a Magic Fest and play the GP or find higher stake local tournaments.     And imho Standard Showdowns aren't really higher competition than FNM, both are quite casual compared to all other events

UnSanctioned Sealed Deck Construction|Jam two of the 15 card decks together to make one 60 deck.  That’s how the box was intended to play.
Deckbuilding for a young/first-time learner?|At this point, it's probably about making it a fun experience - so whatever house rules/deck building considerations you need to tweak to make sure she has a good time with your personal version of Magic might be enough.    Then over time consider adding in cards/card types that show off new ideas (I've had people learn with creatures and sorcery speed stuff first, then added in instants and the stack later so as to not overcomplicate things).
Thought experiment - Supplemental Product DFCs|"They explained why double faced cards don't work as flip cards here (scroll down to ""Why aren't the double-faced cards flip cards?"" about 3/4ths of the way down): https://magic.wizards.com/en/articles/archive/feature/unanswered-questions-innistrad-2011-10-10  The three reasons given in the article: they consider flip cards to be a failure, they do not look good, and there's just not much space on the card (they show an image of a double faced card mocked up as a flip card - there's not much room on there, and they're only showing the most simple of double faced cards - imagine trying to fix the text of Huntmaster of the Fells on that card). The rules manager has also expressed zero interest in merging the rules - they're different mechanics with different rules."
Wizards of the Coast 1993 Holiday Card|"Sorry, **it's from 1996**, the greeting inside said ""since 1993"", my mistake.  I don't look at my collection very often."
Reseal?|There are some packs that have cards reversed like that. Even in the same sets. It all depends on the printer. I believe its usually Japanese printers that put cards in that order.
MTG Arena: State of the Game – March 2020|> For those of you unfamiliar with phantom events, this means that rarity distribution doesn't matter and you may end up with a lot more than six rares or mythic rares in your Sealed pool.

Combos for a breya edh deck|Anything that makes infinite mana since breya sacs herself.   I currently run: Worldgorger dragon + animate dead/dance of the dead/necromancy. You need a combination of lands and mana rocks that come in untapped and another creature in someone’s graveyard to break the loop or breya to already be in play.   Isochron scepter + dramatic reversal: need a combination of mana rocks that makes 3 mana and the ability to make all 4 colors with them.   Dualcaster mage + ghostly flicker: need a combination of lands/mana rocks that can make all 4 colors.   Thopter foundry + sword of the meek + urza: infinite mana and thopters, just need to resolve breya. Can add time sieve for infinite turns but doesn’t really use breya.   You’re also in u/b so pretty much any thassa’s oracle combo. Doomsday, leveler, demonic consultation.   It’s a pretty combo-y commander but it can be scaled well up and down the power level band depending on your playgroup which is nice.
Leyline of Sanctity vs Teyo, the Shieldmage|Sanctity - turn 0 beats all the t1 discard spells and the enchantment is generally harder to remove then the planeswalker and there's more devotion.

Quick question about Sunbird's Invocation's interaction with alternate casting costs.|CMC looks at the upper right, not mana spent to cast it
Superior Numbers – The Rise of the Supercommanders|The question of where P3 started is interesting. Meren is the first Commander I remember seeing in play and saying “I have no idea how to deal with this.”   Even today, she requires repeated kills or repeated graveyard resets, and my experience has been that decks that are prepared to do that are pretty oppressive.  I will say that where I play, we haven’t been completely overrun by these commanders. They get some play when they’re released, folks realize they aren’t that interesting, and then move on.  (Full disclosure: I do use P3 commanders for my son’s decks, which include Tatyova and Atraxa. But he’s 7, so I figure he could use the boost.)

Why The Next Ravnica Set Will Be A Prequel|There COULD be a time travel story, but it won't change the factions. I like Ravnica, but I'm saying this without bias: Ravnica will *not* become anything different than a 'colour pair factions' plane.  Ravnica is popular and MaRo has said that getting rid of a Plane's core identity for a return is a mistake. Returning to one of - if not the - most popular planes and scrapping its main identity is just a bad idea, especially if you need to make it an unbalanced set of factions to do it. (MaRo has also said that the unbalanced factions in Ixalan was a mistake.)
Unsanctioned currently $46 on Amazon. For anyone who was apprehensive about picking it up at the $60 price tag.|I'll just wait until the price drops even further. With how many of these bad boys that are going to rot on big retail store shelves, they will go on clearance for a lot less eventually.
Can we please stop posting images of tokens/cookies/cards/alters, please?|You're in absolutely the wrong subreddit to be posting this kind of tripe. If you want to have more serious discussions about the game itself, try /r/spikes.
Discovered a Nasty Selesnya Token Combo|You say indestructible, but you still lose all your creatures to any non-red board wipe.  And six mana per turn cycle to make *one* token isn't a particularly nasty combo. It's neat that you're basically able to bypass the Mimic Vat exile clause this way, but I wouldn't call it nasty
Standard Vs. Pioneer|Standard, Pioneer and Modern are about even here. 20-30 Players.
Question About Leonin of the Lost Pride|I had the same question, and the answer is you can exile the creature it killed.  When it hits the grave yard, death triggers occur, since regular combat damage is simultaneous both hit the bin at the same time. Since the death trigger occurs in response to hitting the grave, by the time it is on the stack all combat deaths are already in the grave and therefore are legal targets.
Shroud equipment|Yes. The equipment isn't targeted by the ability, the creature is.
Does anyone know the artist or source of this rendition of Ashiok?|https://www.billelis.com/work#/magic-the-gathering/
i cant get into it|It's totally possible Magic just might not be the game for you; just how some people can't get into certain sports or hobbies. Just because your friends play doesn't mean you need to.  While I know that might not be the answer you are looking for, that could be a legit reason; sometimes things just don't work for certain people.
MTG cosplayers talk about the do's and don'ts in cosplay etiquette|So , do's and don'ts is just the same as every other job , which people will never respect , i surely hope the world grows up and starts treating all individuals as just that , individual people whom you should respect.

Totally new to this whole world|"Depends on what you're into, but I'd say magic wiki for becoming familiar with the game, but I also want to recommend Mark Rosewater's (the game's current head designer and has been for a long time) blog Making Magic.   https://magic.wizards.com/en/articles/columns/making-magic  It's been going weekly for years and years now, so there's a lot of content to read up on. For a bit of a ""best of"" there's his ""x and counting"" lists where he looks back on his last hundred articles and picks out the best ones. Here's the most recent one from when he hit 800.  https://magic.wizards.com/en/articles/archive/making-magic/eight-hundred-and-counting-2017-05-15  There's also the various ""storm scale"" articles that are well beloved, rating how likely it is for certain mechanics to return in a standard set, and more recently the ""rabiah scale"", rating how likely we are to return to certain planes.   https://magic.wizards.com/en/articles/archive/making-magic/rabiah-scale-part-1-2018-11-12  Hope that gives you some reading material! It's good shit, if you're into how the game gets designed. (because for me personally it's fascinating)"
A question regarding an interaction between Volrath,the shapeshifter and Willbreaker… and some other questions regarding will breaker.|"1. Yes. When an ability references the card's name, it actually means ""this card"". So you'd control the creature as long as you controlled Volrath.  2. No. The creature is returned. The triggered ability creates a control effect with a duration. Once the named duration is over, control goes back to the original controller.  3. No. Same as 3. Creature is returned when Willbender leaves, not before."
PleasantKenobi pondering White, and places to give its slice of the color pie more depth.|Rhystic Study should be white and Wizards should release a white shifted version of it. I will die on this hill.

Top5 Most Hated Decks In Modern|"If you genuinely ""hate"" a deck in modern you really just don't have respect for that deck and probably tend to lose to it.   Obviously some decks have better matchups than others. But promoting deck hate via a top 5 video like this is just ignorant of the idea that a varied metagame with multiple viable strategies is a good thing for a format."

Came across this gem under Rulings while researching a new EDH deck.|Is there a way that you can get Mairsil to equip to a creature?
Mask of Immolation Mana Cost Question|Only when you want to equip it to something else.
Help me make a hasty decision|Allow me to not answer your question but... Muldrotha is a really good value card, and you don't really need haste if you outgrind your opponents. Haste on the other hand is not really useful, in that putting immediately some damage is not really different than winning later but assuredl. Unless if you kill your opponent right away, which will be rare. Filling your deck with creature that give good value is easier in sultai.
Did you guys know there is a scholarship for Magic The Gathering?|I wish I knew about this BEFORE I graduated. That's $5000 that I could've saved towards a black lotus /s  In all seriousness, to all you high schoolers reading this, you miss all shots you don't take. $5000 is a lot towards college, and all you need to do is submit an essay.  (P.S. to all the CS majors out there, playing MTG helped me figure out the stack. Just sayin)
Beware Walmart MTG section.|This is a pretty common tale. People will buy the product, replace the cards with chaff commons, and then return it, and the people at Wal-Mart or similar stores are none the wiser. It's generally buyer beware if you're buying from a big box store.
Ruling on Richard Garfield, Ph.D.|Only for the rest of the game (and as long as you control Richard). Once the game ends (or Richard leaves play and returns), it resets.
Ok so I’m still learning l, have a BIG question... So what happens when there’s several ETB effects that happen simultaneously? Do I choose which occurs first on the stack?|When multiple triggers need to go on the stack, the active player puts all of the triggers they control on the stack first, followed by the nonactive player, and the nonactive player's triggers will resolve first.
Would people want a Minotaur Discord?|Discord servers are free to make and have no penalty if they don't kick off.
Pauper Tourne GTA|We were six this weekend. There was Infect, Affinity, Mono Green Aggro, Blue Black Delver, Tortex and Rakdos Control. The following tournaments will be on saturday the same time due to the number of event that were organised on sunday at the shop.
Mono Black Artifact Removal|Black doesn't get Artifact Removal.  Just like Red doesn't get Enchantment Removal.  I couldn't tell you about Standard--not my cup of tea--but you're going to have to rely on multicolor or colorless cards to deal with them.
Commander Precons at LGS|Yes! Those preconstructed decks are designed to be a good jumping in point to local tourneys. You might not be competitively up to snuff, but you can still play!
Why is there No Mystery Booster Draft Pre-release?|"Why does there need to be a ""prerelease"" for a product that's effectively been out for months? Also, I'm not sure why you think the release date is Monday - the release date is next Friday.  And my LGS has been hyping Mystery Booster draft weekend for a few weeks now (they're planning on holding multiple drafts over the weekend). That sounds like something your LGS hasn't decided to promote."
SCG Regionals @ The Wasteland Gaming in GA. Which current modern decks are predominant in this store during weekly events ?|Yeah, usually SCG Regionals are 150-200 players (at least here in the midwest), so the decks that show up at that store on a normal week aren't usually what are relevant.  I'm not concerned about what people normally play at Outpost 2000 (the host this spring here in MN), because it'll be such a small sliver of the total playerbase.

Full new art!|Noce island dude
Updated Mystery Booster Draft Simulator?|Haven't found one yet. I expect that draftsim.com en cardsphere get updated sometime today...
What does your LGS do to make your FNM a little extra fun?|My store has a prize box you reach in and grab out of when you register for your draft. Most of the slips say “not a winner”, but there are winners such as free draft, extra prize pack for every drafter, free promo card (this is how they get rid of old promos), etc. it adds a little fun to things
My LGS is having a 50k Tournament|Lol 50k calories, nice!
If Dash Hopes was a cycle, what would the W, R, and G versions be?|The green one draws you a card and makes you hexproof until end of turn.  Jokes aside, it would probably give your opponent a token of some kind, a big one.
MagicFest Question (for parents?)|>The pick and mix option worries me because of the situation at a recent magicfest where the walk up events seem to have been limited to just people with fanatic packages. (this might be a misunderstanding on my part...)  This was pretty specific to GP New Jersey, due to the small hall and more-than-expected attendance.  I was at GP Reno this last weekend and there were no space issues whatsoever.
Uro and Deadeye Navigator|Yes, you can blink Uro as many times as you can pay for.  Then you'll sacrifice it.

First look at the mystery booster foils tomorrow. Confirmed by Gavin.|"Let's see if the ""Insider Information"" on these foils is real or not.  I've compiled a detailed list of possible reprints based on the data I have been collecting for 2 weeks vs mtgstock card prices.  If the foil spoil matches what has been rising/falling exponentially, then I'm going to always look to mtgstocks for 'reprint spoilers'.  The funniest part is, I don't even actively trade magic cards.  I'm doing this for the joy of number crunching and conspiracy theories.  Edit: https://www.reddit.com/r/magicTCG/comments/f5q9yd/well_be_talking_more_about_mystery_booster_foils/   The conspiracy theory by me with initial data and week 1 data is posted there.  It's the top comment."
Does tcgplayer no longer do bonus bucks?|They still do them but they seemed to have scaled it back a bit lately
Is there ANY way to play Arena on a Chromebook or iPhone?|As far as I know you need a PC to run it, and then there's ways to stream it to other devices I think.  I think/hope a mobile version is due out some day, but no idea when.
How do I help my friend who’s struggling in FNM?|Try asking your friend if he still has an interest in going to drafts. He might just be going to hang out with his friends, instead of going to play magic. You could suggest hanging out to play commander on a different day and that he shouldn't feel obligated to come with you to FNMs. Ofcourse, tell him he's still welcome to join ofcourse and that you aren't trying to get rid of him.
My first card with custom art|It's actually kind of impressive you managed to get 6 things wrong with this. (6 and a half, maybe.)  For future reference, /r/custommagic.
A list of top cards in various formats that could be done in Mono white.|I'm not sure I agree about Opt, Preordain or Omen of the Sea. Blue has always been king in cantrips. I also disagree with Witch's Oven. Sacrificing creatures for value is mostly black. Even the soft counters like Mystical Dispute and Spell Pierce don't really feel white. I know that Mana Tithe exists but beyond that and Lapse of Certainty, White has never been strong on counterspells.   Grafdigger's Cage could also be a white card. Same with the passive from Narset.
Rules interaction: The Akroan War and Mayhem Devil|"There is a ruling on Gatherer.  1/24/2020: ""If the creature you took with The Akroan War’s first ability has an ability that triggers when you sacrifice The Akroan War, you control the resulting trigger. If it has an ability that triggers when The Akroan War is put into a graveyard “from anywhere,” check whether that ability should trigger only after the creature’s former controller has regained control of it."""
Planeswalker Card Template for a gift|It might take a lot of editing but you could get an image of a green planeswalker from scryfall.com and photoshop all the text away.
Some rule questions|"1. Tokens aren't even cards. Also, what card limit or you talking about? Cards in hand or in library? 2. Reading the card explains the card, it says ""create a 1/1 spirit"" and doesn't specify control, meaning whoever controls Teysa gets the spirit.  3. Depends, is it a -X/-X spell that reduces toughness, or a damage spell that only seems like it reduces toughness on Arena? 4. Mana burn isn't a thing anymore."
Tournament manager that supports byes?|IIRC, with MTGArena on Appspot you can just manually pair a player with no one, after the random pairings, and it will give them a bye.
I got some feedback about my tokens and their lack of info, so I've made a small text box for the front, and the reverse will have the full art! Best of both worlds. This here is my Germ token for Batterskull!|Yeah, seeing it side by side, it's a great germ, but I would have no idea it was a Germ without the text.
Mystery Booster Retail Set Mechanics List?|There’s I believe over 1600 cards in this set going back to just post reserved list.  Imagine most of not all mechanics are represented.
Ultra Pro Stain Tower Help!!|I've got a bunch of satin towers, some of them are more stuck on then others. The best way I've found is to do a rocking motion with the lid, so you wiggle it until it pops off.
Which is stronger, pioneer or pauper?|There was a similar thread some time ago (though I can't find it). They asked if a tournament allowed you to bring either a Modern or Pauper deck, which would you bring and why? Pauper burn came up a lot in the answers, and for good reason.  Of course, that's a more specific scenario. Pioneer decks are actually less vulnerable to burn because they do not have fetches + shocks to ding their own life total. But Pauper Burn may still be one of the decks that is most powerful in other formats, simply because of how good most of the cards in it are.
Alpha cards redesigned with photo art.|Give Serra Angel a try?
Game State Question|No.  A zero toughness creature will die due to state based actions before any triggers go on the stack.
So my wife bought a mini thermal printer|~~While I know this wouldn't be possible to do~~ I'm just now imagining how much of a power move it would be, when needing to get out a token during your game in an LGS, to just have one of these print out while keeping eye contact with your opponent.  Edited due to factual inaccuracy. TIL You can print stuff like this from your phone.
Is it possible to build a halfway decent samurai tribal deck?|personally I haven't but shapeshifters might help you in your pursuit (it did when i was building my ninja deck)
Question regarding etiquette during gameplay|Something to consider is that the sense of time will be different for both players. The player thinking will be actively busy, while the other is waiting, creating a different mindset. Also easy to loose track of time in this. What can you do to help this?    -Tell your opponent you're thinking. Communicate.  If you need a bit more time, don't be hesitant to say so.    -Plan ahead in your opponents turn    -Be open about the gamestate, and ask the opponent for info if need be.    -If things get too uncomfortable, get a judge. He can have a better perspective on how the two of you are using your time
Rare holo Y symbol?|Take a pic of it so we have an idea of what you're looking at.
Been playing MTG since I was 8 off an on. My son just turned 8 and is really getting into the game, I need some ideas on which of the newer blocks to start collecting and maybe a few deck ideas.|I’m similar, teaching my 9 year old how to play.  At the point you’re at now, you could wait for the Jump Start material that’s coming out later this year, or do what I do: play “pack wars” with core set cards to start then add more expansions as his ability grows.  Core set cards have easy to understand ideas. You could also get the core 20 starter decks that are free, from LGS’s. My LGS still has them. They come with an array of cards that all kind of work together and the ones I have came with Shivan Dragon so my kid loved that.   Pack wars are fun because there’s no real combos to worry about. You could get the 15 cards in the pack then 5x3 lands and you’re all set. Shuffle them together and go for it.  That really helped him learn and not be overwhelmed and shut down from the complexity of the game.   Good luck!
Magic Duels Origins|No, all support was discontinued and the servers shut down.
What kind of decks do people play at FNM's?|It depends on the LGS.  First, what format do they play? Not all FNM are Standard. There could be Pioneer, Modern, Draft, Commander, etc.  Second, it depends on the people who play at the LGS.
Rules regarding Priority|Anger of the Gods uses the stack and can be responded to. The damage is not dealt until the Anger resolves. So yes, you can respond to the Anger by transform the Keeper so it survives.
When will the 2020 challenger decks rotate out of standard?|Standard rotates in the fall, which will make some of the cards in the decks illegal.  Whatsinstandard.com

How much do you shuffle before and after game 1/2 ? What is the best method (pile shuffle)?|> Always wondered what are players thought on shuffling techniques and strategy. I usually shuffle prior to game 1 and do a pile shuffle after game 1 and game 2.  Firstly, pile *counting* is not *shuffling*. It is not random, and so calling it a shuffle is misleading. The rules state that you may perform one pile count between games to ensure your deck is the right number of cards, but you still need to fully randomise your deck.  > Has there ever been any study on the correlation between time shuffling vs winning percentage ?  No, and there would be no point in that. If the way you shuffle is increasing your odds of winning, then you aren't shuffling properly. Shuffling should give a truly randomised deck, if you are gaining an advantage from your shuffling then your deck can't be fully randomised.
Looking for a specific card, I need help!|Specifically insect tokens? Not really. A quick Gatherer search turns up two cards that could create insects due to an upkeep trigger: Crawling Sensation and Phyrexian Swarmlord.
Are you still attending FNM with the virus going around?|Too much opportunity for spread, and magic players aren't always the cleanest of people. If you go, wash your hands often or bring hand sanitizer. Don't eat during a match or even in the place. Sanitize your playmat, dice, etc. after.  Stay safe, peeps. The illness isn't deadly for most, but we gotta protect the vulnerable among us.

When does hungering hydras ability resolve?|The Hydra has a triggered ability that triggers when it's deal damage. This trigger uses the stack and can be responded to.   If you have a 3/3 Hydra and I cast Lightning Bolt on it, before the Hydra's trigger can even go on the stack, state-based actions see that the Hydra is a 3/3 with 3 damage marked on it, and it dies before it can get the counters. That also means that if you have a 5/5 Hydra, you attack with it, and I block with a 2/2, I can respond to the Hydra's trigger after combat damage is dealt (before it gets the counters) by casting Lightning Bolt to deal three more damage to the Hydra so it dies before it can get the counters.
Paradise Druid vs. Shadowspear|It does not gain hexproof again. Paradise Druid has a static ability, it is not an activated ability. Shadowspear says no, you don't get hexproof for the rest of the turn.

My first deck|The cards in booster packs can be added to the deck you already have, generally replacing cards you don't like. You can pretty much put any cards in your deck as long as it has at least 60 cards. If you want to play in a local tournament though there are some restrictions on what cards you can use based on the format. For example standard only allows the cards printed since Guilds of Ravnica (the 6 most recent sets).

Sacrifice Cost + Cast Timing Help|You're attempting to put both triggered abilities on the stack at the same time, so you get to choose their order. Note that Arena auto orders triggers by default, but you can turn this off on the options.  Even though the sacrifice happens as you were casting the spell you can't put a triggered ability on the stack until the next time a player would receive priority. And you can't get priority during the casting of a spell.

"You are allowed to remove a ""may"" ability from one card and add it to another. What two cards are you changing?"|I would put the Leyline effect on any instant or sorcery. The game rules say:  >**110.4.** There are five permanent types: artifact, creature, enchantment, land, and planeswalker. **Instant and sorcery cards can’t enter the battlefield and thus can’t be permanents.** Some tribal cards can enter the battlefield and some can’t, depending on their other card types.  But it never says they can’t start the game already on the battlefield.
Big Questions: Where is the Netflix MTG Anime? When does Legends closed beta begin?|Netflix Anime series date hasn't been announced yet. Most Netflix Anime series have a 4-6 month production time between annoucement and release. Given this one is higher profile, I think that a year is probably reasonable.       IMO (and this is a wild guess based on information available, and is *NOT* fact based), we're looking at Summer of 2020 for release.

Magic LGS torunaments in Stuttgart?|Hi, I am an active player in Stuttgart area. First of all locator.wizards.com is the way to find stores in an area. The store I frequently go to is in Esslingen called Würfelzwerg. We switch each week between Modern and Pioneer for FNM, but always Standard. This Friday (6th March) is Pioneer. Currently we have quite a small playerbase.
Why are Slivers not competitive?|"If you mean in Modern, it's because they're not consistently fast enough to compete as a pure aggro deck in the vein of Mono-Red Prowess, and they lack the tools to work as a disruptive aggro deck in the vein of Humans. They're also very vulnerable to removal, both of the spot and mass variety, their protection against it simply not being good enough.  You can probably still bring it to an FNM or various MTGO events and see success, but that's why they aren't a ""meta"" deck."
Help me not lose Friday Night Magic at my FLGS!|If you don’t have a lot of spare cash, I seriously advise against spending money on a “format” that will be played once.  What format is the usual FNM you attend, Standard? What’s your budget? If you can answer these two questions I’m sure people here will be more than happy to help.
The Gitrog Monster On Arena|There's almost nothing in that decklist that synergizes with Gitrog. It's even missing Fabled Passage. It may be a functioning golgari deck but as a Gitrog deck it's a disgrace.

How would you guys feel about a rotating ban list?|For a mode that lasts a week or two in MTGO and MTGA? Hell yes.  Playing with friends casually? Sounds like a blast.  But there are a lot of people who play either online or in paper who scrape by enough cash to eventually build a budget meta deck and if their collection got banned they just wouldn't be able to play which is a bummer.
New Player wondering where to start|It really depends on how you want to play magic, if you want to just be casual and play with friends I would recommend picking up event decks or whatever they are producing at the time. Maybe some boosters and then go to your local gaming store for singles. If you want to take it more seriously then go look up deck lists, watch live magic on Twitch and buy the deck you want to play and begin your collection like that, buying singles to make sure you're getting the cards you want. Play arena.

What is a krasis|From the Guildmaster's Guide to Ravnica:  >In the deep sinkholes that serve as laboratories and guildhalls for the Simic Combine, biomancers employ a combination of magic and scientific method to create novel life forms. They coax new morphologies from existing creatures or combine traits from multiple organisms into one, producing the creatures known as krasis. Some krasis are unique creatures that can't reproduce. A few multiply and become part of the guild's standard menagerie.   They don't have any one consistent shape or form, though they generally have reptilian features and are quite large. You could pretty much throw together any number of animal traits and call it a krasis.
Chrome Mox Stipulation|It's called newb-proofing. It makes it harder for players to make a mistake.

Vampire Deck Opinons|It looks like a lit.of fun to pilot. I hope you enjoy building it.
Thinking of an objective, quantifiable measure to compare diversity between formats|You might be interested in looking into the information-theoretic concept of entropy. If you have percentages of each deck in the format, then ignoring percentages less than 1% (for example) and calculating the entropy of the resulting distribution would be one possibility.   As another post points out, this doesn't take into account how similar or different 'different' decks are to one another. Another possibility would be to do directly calculate the entropy of the distribution of how many copies of each different card are played - in a sample from trackers, or from top-8s, or whatever. This might be better, though it has its own problems.

Maybe only at White's upkeep if you want to balance it. Since White is seen as typically the slowest color compared to the other colors, I think it would be on flavor for White.

Red backed cards? Anybody know why I might have cards that are slightly more red on the back? Would have come from a booster. Both the cards I have noticed are rates from RNA|The RNA Redbacks were a known error on a set of rares. I've sold a couple of them (Blood Crypt, Lavinia, Smothering Tithe and Judith) for a decent amount.
Why Aren't More Cards Restricted Instead of Banned|Vintage is the only format with a restricted list, and that's only because the point of Vintage is to be the format where nothing is banned for power level reasons. They ban ante cards, conspiracies, manual dexterity stuff, etc., but nothing gets banned for power level reasons.  Every other format just has a banned list.

Alpha Llanowar Elves, help me pick my next subject!|Thanks to MTG I've developed a passion for anything creative and the fantasy genre that has served me well through the years.   So finally decided to paint one artwork per set as a tribute to the amazing art of this game: just done with Elves from Alpha and wanted to share it with the community, moving on to Arabian Nights!  As I only get to do one per set trying to pick artwork that is iconic as well as interesting from a visual standpoint: Alpha was a tough call to make with cards like Hurloon Minotaur (also by the amazing Anson Maddocks), and Shivan Dragon in the same set...So what Arabian Nights card would you pick, think it's most beautiful, or iconic?  Let me just say I have a weak spot for Cuombajj Witches... but I'm thinking of doing either Juzam Djinn or Bird Maiden at the moment!
Vendor backs out of GP Lyon due to Corona Virus|Better safe than sorry.
Skullbriar, the Walking Grave - BG - Casual MtG / Magic Commander EDH deck walkthrough|No hard feelings but I'm jumping straight into critique  Just scrolling through a pile of cards isn't particularly engaging. Look at The Commander's Quarters for an example of presenting a deck as more than literally just a pile of cards.   Your microphone is pretty tinny and should be your first hardware upgrade if your want to make better videos. This and presentation formatting are probably the two most important things for making your videos not just palatable but enjoyable.  The camera angle is very cramped and provides a distractingly unflattering view of what I would otherwise assume is an excellent playmat.

Need help/tips/tricks moving from online draft to paper|At FNM, you can look at your picks.  > Players and teams may not look at their drafted cards between or during picks at Competitive and Professional Rules Enforcement Levels. At Regular Rules Enforcement Level, players are allowed to review their drafted cards between or during picks as long as they are holding no other cards at the same time. The Head Judge may choose to disallow this provided they announce it before the first draft. Between boosters there is a review period in which players may review their picks.

Gaining deathtouch before SBAs are checked|You do things in the order that they're written in. So first it deals damage, then you draw which is replaced by dredging, then it gains deathtouch. It only gained deathtouch after it dealt damage, so the damaged creature isn't destroyed.

Unsanctioned Foil Lands?|The ones I opened were perfect. I am not sure why EVERY special products aren't printed this way, but I am very happy with Unsanctioned Foil Lands I opened.
Best sleeve combo for foiled out EDH deck|KMC Perfect Hard inner sleeves will help counter any warping but they will make the deck extremely thick.  You could try the Dragon Shield Sealable inner sleeves. They aren't as think but it might help keep moisture from getting in or out, which will help the foils stay straight.  I always use Dragon Shield Matte outer sleeves, specifically black. They're the perfect combination of durability, shuffle feel and protection without dulling foils.
What would the best sleeves for double sleeving?|Kmc inners and dragon shield matte IMO.  Edit: source 20 years of magic.

We just want to point out how it's implementation could be better.
Returning shapeshifters/copy creatures to your hand|The clone is still a creature  A copy of a creature is still a creature, copy is not a card type. So yes you can, unless its a token copy, in which case you can still return it, it just vanishes upon doing so.  Once returning to hand the clone is its original self and no longer a copy

I don't see enough of Arcane Adaptation played in Tribal Commander...|As a sliver player, why would I want it? It's already an absurdly well supported tribe, I don't want to include some do nothing enchantment to maybe make some off tribe cards good.  It's actually better in less supported tribes, where you have to fall back to changelings and adaptation/conspiracy effects

Budget Modern blue-white deck featuring GE Kefnet?|Not to be that guy but Modern + around 50$ is just gonna be a hard thing to find.  Best of luck to you though.
Proliferate and Athreos|The simple answer is no. The proliferate from Martyr cannot create a counter that doesn’t already exist AND the returned Martyr will never return with a coin counter.
Modern or pioneer?|I would say modern is in a better system right now but that's very debatable. I think you would prefer pioneer right now because the best decks right now are all combo decks, namely dimir inverter and lotus breach, but that's also why people think it is worse. Pioneer also cheaper

Magic Fest question|Packages are worth it, highly recommend them for full weekend of sideevent fun.
I miss being excited about lore and card-story ties in|It’s obvious the Theros story tie in was botched on some level. What we got was not what they had planned or wanted. I’m assuming there was tie in media that eventually got canned and unpublished.   I would view our current lack of story as an anomaly they’re trying to fix. Hopefully things get back on track in the next set.   If there’s one thing to take comfort in, it’s the fact that WotC knows the current level of story isn’t acceptable and is at least working to change that for future sets.
Charming Prince|"The ability reads:  > Exile another target creature you own. Return it to the battlefield under your control at the beginning of the next end step.  ""Target creature"" means only a creature permanent on the battlefield:  > 109.2. If a spell or ability uses a description of an object that includes a card type or subtype, but doesn’t include the word “card,” “spell,” “source,” or “scheme,” it means a permanent of that card type or subtype on the battlefield.  Therefore the ability can only target a creature that is already on the battlefield, not creature cards that are in other zones like your library.  In general, remember that cards in Magic are almost unbelievably literal. If it meant to say ""search your library for a creature card, exile it, then put it on the battlefield"", *it would say that*."

Question about MagicFest Constructed Fanatic package and Pauper/vouchers|Yes, you can use double-up vouchers for regular events.

CFBE does let you turn in unused vouchers for some amount of tix, based on what type of voucher it is.

Can anyone suggest me some verry budget big dynos for a commander deck? Under 2 $ each|Tribal Dino’s? Like honestly instead of getting as many under 2 as possible focus on getting the important ones. Like ghalta is worth more than 4 shitty Dino’s.  What are you hoping to do?   I’ve built gruul, Naya ,bant ,and Jund Dino’s in 60 card and various iterations of Naya Dino’s in edh. Happy to share some insight
You think we'll ever get a legendary vehicle as a commander?|Weatherlight itself as a five color legends matter commander rather than sisay mostly serving as that would have been pretty cool.
Naya dyno tribal removal?|As in removal against or to put in a Dino Tribal deck? And what format?
Commander Deck with Ashiok and Exiling|Definitely a fun commander deck their, though you might struggle to get enough cards that fit. Probably some sort of esper (or more) control with lots of the proccessor cards from BFZ. Also maybe a steal/ graveyard/ superfiriends/ eldrazi subtheme could work.  I would think something like:  Sen triplets  Mererki ri  Yentte could be fun for a lower power build  Atraxa if you decide to go the superfriends route  O-kagatchi could work as well  If you are okay with just going two colors, circu would be exactly what you are looking for.  Oona also works great with exile  Or you could go more generic and run a partner with tymna for general card advantage and a more goodstuff approach.
Secret Lair Theros Canada customs surprise|This can happen in any country, even those that are not on this list. You pay taxes/customs in advance, then you pay it again when it arrives and you have to spend hours and hours dealing with it. Secret Lair is basically US only product. I don't think it's worth the time.

The next MTG releases and the coronavirus|I'm sure many, many other companies have already determined that the situation will affect them negatively in regards to profits. I don't see how other factors would be explicitly blamed by WotC.
Best way to start?|There is a beginner series on the official mtg YouTube Channel on how to play and how to build decks.
Im new and dont quite understand lands|"Will add a helpful metaphor that people sometimes use to explain the concept of mana: If you think of mana as milk, lands are cows. You can get milk out of them by ""tapping"" them, but you need to give them time before you can get milk out of them again (they need to untap). Unpasteurised milk doesn't last for long, it goes bad once it's out in the open. This is represented by unused mana ""emptying from the mana pool"" at the end of each step and phase. You can't just stockpile milk (mana) in a bowl (mana pool), it will go bad, so you should only produce it when you need it."

Magic: The Gathering - Armageddon: The arcade game that almost hit arcades worldwide|I think there was a version of this that landed at the Dream Machine arcade that used to be at the Hampshire Mall in Hadley, MA.  I feel like it was there only for a week or two but I remember playing it and thinking it was quite a different experience.  I remember going back soon after playing it only to see it was already pulled from that arcade.  Move the trackball to a position and you throw mana at it, if you keep it in the same spot and throw more, you get a bigger creature.  But that's about all I remember of it.
What are your guys' favorite Tron land artifact decks in Pauper?|Mmm, no. Pauper's artifacts are for the most part hardly impressive. Artifact matters synergies are better enabled by artifact lands, Affinity, and Atog.  Ulamog's crusher ain't a bad card in the format, but it simply doesn't hold a candle to controlling tron builds.

New here, asking for some combo rulings|Thinking quickly, Dave created an infinite combo using nothing but Geist of Saint Traft, Voltaic Key, and an infinite combo!
"Ruling question : Can you ""use"" the target of a spell for its additional cost ?"|Targets are chosen before costs are paid. It is possible to target a card in your graveyard when you're choosing targets, then exile that card when you're paying costs (which means that the Dust won't do anything when it resolves since its only target is illegal when it goes to resolve).

Pondering getting into paper from arena, is draft the way to go?|Biggest change in moving from arena to paper is that nothing is automated. You have to remember your triggers and know the rules as they won’t just automatically happen. If you have any issue, always best to call a judge and ask for a ruling.   People are pretty forgiving in LGS environments and you can just let people know that you’re new to paper and to excuse any lapses in etiquette. If someone says that to me, I’ll always be super nice and will point out certain best practices...just as an example, some people will put dice on a creature to remind them it got a pump from an anthem effect or something, but you should really only use dice for counters as you will likely forget them and that’s just the convention.

Odd question for you all. What accessories can you not go without when it comes to MTG? What accessories are you looking to pick up?|Sleeves & deckboxes are the two musts. I always use Dragonshields for sleeves, and whatever decent box my LGS carries. Usually a Boulder, but I prefer the Xenoflips.  Playmat is next. Easier to grip your cards & LGSs are dirty.   A few D20 are good. I buy a fat pack from every set and do a pre-release, and I've accumulated more than enough this way. Most LGS will sell random loose ones if you need more. I don't always use d20s THAT much, but they do come in handy.   Surprisingly best investment I've made - A box of the small d6s is where it's at. Not sure of the brand, but it's a rectangular box if 36 small d6. Various colors and looks. These are what I use for most tokens & counters. I have two colors in case I have two different types of counters going, for some reason.   Some kind of bag for your dice.   That's about all. I don't out my mat in a tube or anything. I have an older hiking backpack that's in good shape I use for my decks. I just kinda pile them in there. Works for me.

D&D Campaign Across Multiple Planes|>How does the established lore allow for a campaign like this?  Post-Mending walkers can't carry tagalongs save extremely specific exceptions (Will and Rowan share a spark, Jiang totes around Mowu and only Mowu) and an instance of bad writing (Kaya. Why did they do that to her...?). Pre-Mending walkers _can_ carry tagalongs with complete ease, but keep in mind Pre-Mending walkers were virtually Gods and that that's probably not where you want your campaign to be.  You'd want it to be something specific - a device like the Planar Bridge would do - but keep in mind that that kind of device is exceedingly, insanely rare. If it exists and more than one Plane's worth of people know about it, then chances are it's on some evil people's radar, namely Bolas. If you feel like tying in to the core Magic plot super hard, you could have your campaign take place before Kaladesh and have the device your players use to travel be on Bolas' radar, essentially making him the phantom BBEG of your campaign; alternately, you could simply _replace_ the actual Magic plot, such as by having the Planar Bridge misfire and pull your protagonists into Kaladesh during its construction - giving you a clean starting plane and a conflict to contend with.
Altered Yasova Dragonclaw|Nice! She is my favorite commander!
I want to start doing lore videos. What do you guys think?|"A couple of comments: the middle part where you actually talk about Breya, is very good. I have no idea if what you say is completely correct, but it was very well-structured, easy to understand and voiced in a clear way. I also love the fact that the lore videos are so short. Makes me more inclined to ckick on them. The choice of words and the tone of voice in the introduction seems too generic to me (""In this episode, we're gonna talk about...""). Try to put a little more of your own personality in it. I would say something like ""In this episode, let's dive into the story of a relatively unknown magic legend"". See what fits for you. As for the end of the episide, your voice sounds kind of bored there, contrasting to when you talked about Breya herself. The signing off part is, however, as important as the actual content part. Here too, you should try to find your own tone of voice. For instance, listen to the way Marshall Sutcliffe talks about how great Channelfireball is in the Limited Resources podcast . Even after 500+ episodes, he always comes up with interesting and inspired ways to say the same thing. Other than that, keep on making awesome video's! You're on the right track! And we can't ever have anough MTG lore videos"

Graveyard exiled, need card to redo|"The same way creature-based strategies deal with wraths - don't overcommit. Bait out graveyard interaction by doing something ""scary"", but not nearly as scary as what you're actually trying to do. They either go for it and the coast is clear, or they don't, and you get to keep getting value out of your graveyard until you force their hand."
Does Volrath, the Shapestealer retain his name after using his ability?|"He changes his name. The ability still works.  If a card references itself by name, it just means ""this object"". He doesn't need to actually be named ""Volrath the Shapestealer"" to keep copying. Same for commander damage. It is tracked for the object, so he keeps dealing it."
Has everyone received their Stargazing bundle but me?|No, not everyone has received them. I'll copy and paste my response from the last thread asking this below:     I know it can be stressful waiting for a product without confirmation, and that's a fault with how WOTC/Scalefast have been handling this product, but the information you're looking for is readily available. What what you're experiencing is common for the secret lair product.   Shipping is done in waves, if you aren't one of those who purchases early-on it can take (quite) some time for them to print and ship all of the orders, so you need to expect to be patient. For example, there are some buyers who have posted who still haven't received their Year of the Rat yet, but follow-ups with Scalefast indicate that it's just them still churning through the printing. When I ordered bitterblossom it took \~2.5 months for it to reach me in Canada.  If you are concerned with your order status email help support for Scalefast. But you should know that your experience is not atypical for this product. In the future, I would encourage you to search for a topic before making a new thread because, this has been asked multiple times for each secret lair. It's something they are upfront about when you order, and should be common knowledge, even if it's a poor business practice.
How active is standard in your area?|My LGS does exclusively Standard for FNM and brings in 15-25 players each week (sometimes more, their record is 34 I think). Only time it didn't fire that I can remember was the Friday after this past Christmas.  I'm in California's Central Valley.
Khan's cube - boy they messed it up|The cube is fine imo. I've had a ton of success with UGx morph and the Sultai self-mill deck. In fact about the only archetype I haven't found to be great is Boros, it's ok but nothing special. And a variety of archetypes is healthy, if it was all durdle it would get old quick.

Sleeving the Unsanctioned half-decks using 5 different colored sleeves?|Alternatively, use the same color outer sleeves, but also use inner sleeves and write ON the inner sleeve in sharpie in a corner which color deck it belongs to.  This way you don't reveal info by using different colored sleeves, and it's easier to separate afterwards.

Siona, Captain of the Pyleas and Shielded by Faith infinite combo|Yes
Repacks at big box stores|MJ Holdings is the biggest distributor of these, and usually when pieces are missing, it’s most likely due to the original product having been sabotaged (opened and resealed and returned; damaged; stolen in store).   The big thing to know is the value found is *extremely* risky.  I’ve been cautious and careful myself in the past to attempt and discover contents without opening them, with two of the four 2017 Commander precons being my best finds.   I know blind buys can be exciting, almost like a Chaos draft or something, but I urge you to be careful with these because they’re designed for you to waste money on things like free welcome decks, repacks missing pieces, or my favorite : land packs.
Best online card collector & deck builder?|I've just started using delver lens. Thus far it's been very bug free, quick to just scan your cards and does everything you've said. I'm currently a big fan
Which 1v1 non-rotating format are you more likely to find others to play with|I have no data for this, but:  Modern has been around a long time, its likely a heck of a lot of players have a modern deck lying around that they can use. The ubiquitous nature of the format means it should be accessible. Wile the meta shifts, you can generally rely on most decks still being functional a few years from now.  Pioneer is the new darling, although now more stable there is still a lot of hype and excitement around it as a new format. A lot of players are in to building and brewing. That said the format is still in an experimental stage and there is no guarantee that a deck will remain viable in the long run.  Best bet as you imply is to speak to the people you expect to play with, but otherwise go with whichever of these you find most interesting.  Legacy is the odd one out here, while a fantastic format with huge longevity, it is expensive to get in to. I love my legacy deck but I don't get to play it as much as I would like.

Trying to learn. Where to start?|Get MTG arena if you can.
Mtg - how much change with each minor and major release?|Magic will introduce a few new keywords (card abilities) each set, but they will always explain what they do and will usually just be different configurations of things that have been done before. None of them make you feel as if you are playing a new game, and when in doubt reading the card will explain the card.  &#x200B;  How often you need to buy new cards will also depend on what format you want to play. If you want a more competitive format like Standard or Pioneer you may need to update your decks fairly frequently. For Commander (a multiplayer format, can be more or less competitive depending on your playgroup) you can update your decks with every set or never. I've got a few commander decks I haven't updated in well over a year that still perform admirably.

Confused about basic land typed|"There are five basic land types: Forest, Mountain, Swamp, Plains, and Island. ""Wastes"" is not a basic land type - it's the name of a basic land, but Wastes do not have any land types. Snow is a supertype, not a land type. Coalition Victory does not care if you control a Wastes or not. Likewise, it doesn't affect Might of Alara - the biggest bonus it can give is +5/+5."
Coming back to magic (still a noob)|Glancing at your current deck list, I'd say the biggest issue is lack of consistency. I know it's tougher to make a consistent deck out of cards you just have lying around, but what I would recommend is figuring out which cards in your deck perform well, and which ones you kind of groan at when you draw them because they aren't as helpful. Try and trade for or buy more copies of the cards that work well in your deck and replace the lower performing cards with the multiple copies of the better ones until you have four copies of each good one.  Honestly, even if it's just a common card, if it synergizes with the rest of the deck well, having four copies of it will mean that each game plays more consistently, which will make it much easier for you to identify any issues you have with either your deck, or any mistakes you might make repeatedly. And don't worry, literally everyone who plays makes mistakes; the most important thing is to recognize them when you do them so you can avoid doing them in the future.  To add to the above, figure out what the main goal of your deck is and put in cards that help you accomplish that goal specifically. Do you want to put a bunch of small creatures on the board and overrun them? Or just a few big ones that can smash through the blockers they have? Or maybe you want to control what your opponents can do and hold them back until you have enough mana to cast a really big, game ending spell. Once you know your main strategy, it's much easier to figure out which cards to cut from the deck and replace with others that help you go for that specific win condition.
Looking for starting in-person|"Don't worry too much about being shy. Spend some time on Google and Find a LGS (local gaming store) that hosts events and just go to an fnm or a random weeknight standard event. You obviously have to aquire the cards to play, but you don't need the most competitive list to have a good time. You probably won't make true friends your first night but stick with it and you 100% will. Magic brings people together in a special way and sharing it as a common interest makes social situations easier than you might imagine. You just talk about magic and it tends to work. With all that said they're are surely such a thing as LGS bullies, but I assure you that in most reputable environments (which should exist in Miami for sure) if you just stick with it in your local scene it will prove worthwhile.  Edit: don't be afraid to just mention that you are new to paper magic and might be a little out of your element. The vast majority of lgs events are very friendly to this and you will likely find ""mentors"" around every corner.   Also I understand that what I'm describing is very scary but I can't recommend it enough. A few years ago I suffered an episode of extreme chronic depression, and upon it's upswing while I was still unable to reach out to old friends I for whatever reason (because I was falling in love with the game again) found it within myself to go play magic with strangers, because that was my only option. It might have saved my life."
Deck Feedback|This deck is legal in the modern format, but I would not recommend bringing it to a modern tournament. There are 2 issues with it from a causal glance and I want to outline them.  1. Consistently - This deck has many one of copies and very few play sets . This means that you will often need a card but will have a low chance of drawing it. I would fix this by seeing what cards have the highest impact and then playing 3-4 copies of those (if possible I understand money can be an obstacle here)  2. Speed - Modern is very fast this deck is not. I would recommend watching some modern gameplay videos to get an idea of how fast. I think you will be overrun and out gunned with this deck, I do think you might be more successful in the pioneer format (with a few tweaks)  but it’s still going to be tough. Keep in mind what actions you want your deck to do each turn and how you will interact and eventually win against your opponent. This will help you plan.  I hope these are not to critical and help out a bit
Any good draft tips|Don't marry a theme early on.  Just assume your deck won't be optimal.

Questions about Counters|It'll still get the counters on it. Heroic only cares that it was targeted by a spell, not that that spell resolves. Lifelink is countered but the centaur has the counters
Beginner with Magic playing The Wilds and the Deep|I would play a few more games, get a hang of the parts of your turn, playing at instant speed, just general game mechanics then go to your Local Game Store, there you can find people who play all sorts of formats as well as explaining more of the nuance of the game to you. There is a lot to learn but take it at your own pace. Eventually you should upgrade your decks, either trying to build upon what you already have or buying one of the better preconstructed products and building on that. Take your time because magic has a lot of things to unpack but your players at your local game store will help you more than the internet and you will get better really by just playing and learning. Ask questions, ask to look at other peoples cards and decks, learn the game and find your playstyle.
MTG deep learning HELP|Strongly recommend the 'Level One' article series by Reid Duke for anyone looking to get into tournament magic
Why people dropping from draft is bad?|A normal draft has 8 players, if one drops every round a player that would want to play is without an opponent.     Not the worst but you of course prefer that everyone who wants to play also gets to play
Beginner budget deck (Casual)|Commander or no? If no, mono-green and mono-black are nice, I love the simic guild of Ravnica, and gruul is really easy just play big boys. If it is commander, pick a green legendary creature and fill your deck with mana gain and big boys.
"What cards would you put into a ""custom booster"" for Unsanctioned's Booster Tutor?"|Use a draft simulator to open a pack of your choice, the  sleeve up an ad card to represent the chosen card.
i need help competing this commander deck. Deck|By my quick count you have 56 non-land cards listed here, including a Sol Ring and a Signet. Your mana curve isn't super high, and you don't have loads of really difficult mana costs on that curve.   44 lands would be \*a lot\* for this deck, meaning you have a little bit more space for spells in my opinion. Even if you have 44 mana sources, you probably want a few of them to be mana rocks/accelerants of some sort - you can only play one land per turn, and being able to get out your bigger spells faster will prove consistently helpful.      Looking at the mix of cost on this deck, I reckon that you have 6 - 8 slots where you can add more 'real cards' (creatures/spells). In terms of what works best for you in those slots, there's obviously tonnes of options (this is Commander after all), but looking at what you're working with, some solid Goblin choices might include Pashilik Mons, the aforementioned Skirk Prospector and maybe a Goblin Sharpshooter.      In terms of what lands to add, wherever you have lands that can produce either red or black that will be helpful, but I wouldn't sweat it too much. If you skew things a little toward making red mana you won't be a million miles off, and you ought to be able to fit in a small number of colourless lands that do cool things without it stopping you from being able to cast spells a lot of the time. A Rogue's Passage or Ghost Quarter is not going to leave you stuck on coloured mana often, but will occasionally help a lot.      The beauty of Commander is that at a lot of tables you won't be too punished for having a deck that's a work in progress. My recommendation would be to start at about 37 lands in here, play some games and see how you feel. If you are missing mana on a regular basis, then adding a rock or two wouldn't hurt, and if you're getting flooded a lot, or finding that your cards seem a little low impact, then you can tweak here too. In the latter case though, I'd suggest trying not to cut lands for spells, so much as switching out for cards that let you do more with your mana. For example, a Flamewave Invoker or a Grenzo, Dungeon Warden give you something to do with all that mana, giving you options at lots of stages in the game.

Unsanctioned rules situation question (Yet Another Aether Vortex and Slaying Mantis)|I think the spirit of YAAV is that cards can be in multiple zones at the same time and that therefore you would throw it but you would not flip over the next top card of your library because the Mantis is still the top card of your library.

Single/Double sleeve, Perfect Fit vs Regular sleeve, for binder storage?|Yes, double sleeving is usually overkill for storage. I usually put my stuff in perfect fits and that's more than enough protection.  If something needs more protection than that, put it in a hard plastic toploader or snap/screw case.  If you have foils store them in KMC Perfect Hard inner sleeves. They're thicker, more durable and help counter warping.
A mural of posters I made from the backs of Bundles|I’ll try to make some criticism that is constructive and might help you out with the layout.   It’s a nice idea to have them as deco, though you might want to make a few changes so it doesn’t look as thrown on the wall like it is (no offense).  I think you want a consistent pattern in your layout first (like either have them form one or 2 shapes that have consistency rather than multiple with no organisation. Maybe you want to do something that will go across (like 2 posters vertically Times 4 or 5 posters horizontally) or all the horizontal on one side and all the vertical on the other.   And you should probably make space for them by moving the other frames ;) they kinda make it hard to make the rest somewhat cohesive.   Hope it helps (cuz somepeeps wheren’t quite as helpful with the cristicism)
Ranking standard meta decks by days remaining in the format|Information about how much of a deck is staying in Standard is useful, but perhaps a more helpful way to show it would just be the number of rotating cards in each deck? That would also make it easy to do a breakdown of the rarities of the rotating cards - maybe between two decks, one has more total rotating cards, but fewer at high rarities.
Opinion: I use sleeves for my own benefit, protecting the cards is just bonus.|It's also easier to shuffle cards when they are sleeved.
Magic Fest Reno Lost Items|I’m guessing you already asked a judge if there’s anything like that in lost and found? Other than that, I hope you find your stuff
Any news about the mystery booster foils?|We know that all the foils will be cards that have been foils before. Also, apparently someone got some of the store version of Mystery Boosters and put the foils on ebay, so the following cards have been spoiled:   Blighted Agent  Reaper King  Isamaru, Hound of Konda  Marrow-Gnawer    Your theory that they're trying to keep it a mystery sounds reasonable to me.

Great first FNM draft experience|I actually had like the same experience.

Some far more experienced players we're happy to let me watch their game, to then answer my questions about why they made the decisions they did afterwards and to give pointers about my deck building which is a skill I know I need to work on. The entire experience was really exhilarating. I can't wait until next week.

Results in the last days are also quite similar with both decks posting a few 5-0's and other solid results without doing anything outbreaking.  So based on stats both decks are quite comparable at the moment. But also both decks are not top tier at the moment.

Repeated commons in Theros Beyond Death - Mistake?|Packs printed in Belgium can rarely contain two non-foil copies of one specific common, depending on the set. It's usually a colorless artifact if the set has any at common. For THB it's Bronze Sword, for ELD it's Gingerbrute, for M20 it's Stone Golem.  Packs printed in the US shouldn't have duplicate commons except when one is a foil, but can have a different oddity: for most sets, there are three colors where it's possible (but quite rare) for a pack to contain zero cards of that color. Usually those colors are white, blue and red.

Try running red looting effects with some of the recursion cards for artifacts. beacon of unrest seems like a fine addition to this deck imo. as far as your maybe board goes... Olivia should be in this deck other than that it can all stay in the maybe someday pile. hope you have fun with the deck but if you want consistency your gonna need more ramp and card draw.

Sneak peek of next update to Dragon Counter, a life tracking app. You guys told me to add poison, commander tax, mana, experience, storm and charge counters :). I hope you like the implementation, the idea behind is to always have a clean looking app. EDH damage is also quickly accesible here :)|Your app looks awesome, and will already likely be my go-to app for life with these new additions considering how well they look like they're going to be integrated, but I would be remiss if I didn't ask for the thing I've been looking for in a life app forever.  When you start up a new game, if you select 1 player, I'm wondering if you could include the option to have all of the long press options shown. (I'm imagining the 1 player screen would look like the current two-player screen, with the extras shown in the space where your opponent's life would be) As someone that almost exclusively plays combo and storm decks, having a single-player life tracker where life, mana pool, and storm count are all easily accessible and visible on a single screen, while still looking sexy is my wet dream.

Haven't played since revised - catch me up with a few questions please|"Old cards are playable in some formats, mostly Vintage, Legacy, Commander, and very much so in a casual format called Old School (/r/oldschoolmtg) which even follows old rules. Format definitions for official formats (https://magic.wizards.com/en/game-info/gameplay/rules-and-formats/formats) and banned & restricted lists (https://magic.wizards.com/en/game-info/gameplay/rules-and-formats/banned-restricted) cover this in more detail.  As for power levels, some old cards are exceptionally strong still, but most are not as the game had evolved in many meaningful ways since 1995. Part of this is rules changes. It would take a long time to cover all the changes, so tl;dr is it's almost a different game.  Essential cards vary by format. If you still have moxes or dual lands, you could easily trade for anything you'd ever need. Check sites like tcgplayer.com for prices. I recommend buying some card sleeves to protect your older cards. Many are worth over a thousand dollars each.   ""Standard"" is a defined format, as covered above. It only includes cards printed in recent sets. Older copies of reprints are ok but you're unlikely to find much in your current collection based on what you've written.  ""Kitchen table"" or ""casual"" magic games still happen, but most casual games I see now are a newer format called Commander. It would take a while to learn, as it has a lot of new rules, in addition to the game rules changes from 6th and 10th edition (and then some) but it's still likely the most welcoming format for returning players.  Alternatively, I suggest reaching out to your local game store and asking about Open House and other new player events. You can also check sites like meetup.com to find local playgroups. I'm sure you'll find players happy to bring you back.  Ante is no longer part of the game.  Card prices are all over the place. It's not uncommon to find a card from a recent set jump to $40+, much more so in foil.  I definitely recommend coming back into the game. It's survived so long for reasons.  Another option is to try some of the digital offerings such as Arena. They're a great place to learn and play casually with only new cards, rules enforced by the game, etc.  (opinions in this post are my own and not of my employer. #WOTCstaff)"
Looking for a good deck building and collection management app|Decked Builder. I buy and trade, with a collection up and down around 15,000 cards from alpha to current. I have all my decks cataloged, and a deck called wish list. It syncs in the cloud between my phone, tablet, and laptop; so I can view and organize my cards anywhere.

Thalia Secret Lair Info|"I'm going to flat out concede that this ""isn't for me"", which is fine, because most lairs so far haven't been.  But I do want to ask, ""who is it for?""  This is a product targeted specifically at a Modern/Legacy (read: competitive) crowd.  However, the foil versions of secret lairs so far have all exhibited such obscene levels of curling that there's no way one could reasonably and reliably expect to use these in a competitive setting.  So its a competitive-targeted product that is potentially highly unplayable in a competitive setting.  I just don't get it."
Question about blocking|It's considered blocked, but no damage transpires
New Secret Lair is tied to Historic format on MTGA|30 bucks is cheaper than I thought.  There's a pattern to how they price these that's starting to become clear.  So far, the 40 dollar Secret Lairs have all been 5+ Foil Cards (OMG Kitties and Year of the Rat) featuring a few cards printed as rares (including a few as mythic rares in OMG Kitties, though only in Commander products), OR three foil Mythic Rares (with an asterisk on Kaleisoscope Killers, which featured some cards that would almost certainly be printed at Mythic rare these days). Only one $50 Lair has been announced, and I think rather than the charity bit,  the increased price is supposed to justify the extended art.  I assumed that a playtest of alt art rares would go for 40, compared to the alt art Serum Visions, since Serum Visions is uncommon/common level, but apparently not.   And yes, I'm aware that rarity can be arbitrary in this context,  but I do think it impacts how they make certain pricing decisions.

One with the stars + Tree of Perdition works?|I believe this won't work. Yes, you would use zero if a card enchanted with OWTS's ability refers to it's power of toughness, but that's because that card no longer *has* a power or toughness. It's P/T isn't zero, it just returns a null value when checked because there is nothing there.  For a abilities that cause an exchange to happen, an exchange actually *needs to happen*. You can't make that exchange if one half of it doesn't exist.

Question: is Magic The Gathering Arena welcoming for casual players and newcomers?|Yes and no.  Yes in the sense that you can learn and play the game for free and you can unlock more cards/decks by playing the game and completing daily challenges. It has a forgiving learning curve and I believe you can practice against bots but I'm not sure. You can challenge friends as well, so if you both have accounts you can battle each other.  No in the sense that once you start to get into ranked play, you might be matched up against people who have been playing for a very long time(and have a ton of experience) or people who have a massive collection of powerful rares/mythics.  That being said there are some decks that are very good and aren't made up of many rares, which means you'll be able to craft what you need with wildcards faster. And if you never intend to play anyone other than each other you don't really need to worry about people crushing you or her with expensive competitive decks.

Creating your own Unsanctioned-like experience with theme half-decks?|I put together a cube like this a few years back after playing Smash Up and enjoying the process. I did not go with Un themes though, as that really isn’t my thing. During construction I made sure to seed synergies within each half-deck so that there would be great crossover between multiple sets. You have to also be careful about parasitic synergies that don’t play well with others. I would also recommend double sleeving the cube, and then using something like a sticker / marker on the inner sleeve to help separate back out the decks after a game.
Double sleeving|Dragon Shield for sure. Get the sealable inner sleeves ones too. That ensures no air will get in, so it completely prevents dust/ moister, so you won't get any curling too. I highly suggest, and it's what I use for any of my valuable foils

Do you guys ever play multiplayer (as in EDH) with regular constructed decks?|I've played plenty of non-commander multiplayer. It's good. Commander tends to be more fun because the singleton format makes games crazier and decks less reliable.

I tried scryfall with      o:can't o:""sacrifice creatures""  and      o:can't o:""sacrifice a creature""  The former only catches Angel of Jubilation, the latter catches things that incidentally have ""can't"" in the text and don't do what you want."
Question about 1/0s|Yes, a Creature with a Toughness of 0 or less dies as a State-Based Action.  Of course, that assumes that the thing that buffs them isn't immediately returned to the Battlefield, before the SBA get checked.

Looking to get back into Magic by creating some decks|I quit for awhile after my trade binder got stolen from an LGS. After a few years i found gameknights on youtube which got me into EDH.   From there i started watching deck techs and scouring Tappedout.net for some builds to go off of.   Most people get back into it by the current standard rotation (how i first started personally)  Find your niche by your local meta or jumping into standard  As far as just building decks check out Tappedout.net or deckstats.net.  Tappedout is a tad more user friendly but deckstats has more of an indepth look on how the decks perform.   Hope this little rant helps some
Card Kingdom Battle decks?|Definitely! My playgroup has used them when integrating new players and I always have a couple that I can play against each other for a balanced experience. For new players, players on a very small budget and anyone who wants to play a fun, usually interactive game of magic not decided only by bombs, they are very good. Check out the tolarian community college review of them on YouTube.

Trading at pax east!|Homie, just 2c from someone who’s made 1000+ trades. I would look into trading on a bigger online platform: Facebook groups, our weekly thread, deckbox, mtgsalvation. All of them let you trade without having to walk around a convention center carrying hundreds of dollars worth of cards that can easily walk away while you’re taking a piss or buying a hotdog.  If you’re deadset on bringing your cards, keep them on you at all times. Don’t leave them with your friend who is in the middle of a game. Definitely don’t leave them in your car, with a piece of glass between them and the world.
Why is Colorless Mana not the 6th color?|It's named colorless for a reason...  The fact that edh sees it as a color identity doesn't mean anything. It's a janky format with its own rules. That rule gives it some additional ways to build your decks.
Best/worst possible 4/4 for 4 with one word of rules text|Delve would be pretty busted. Free 4/4?  Two words keywords: first strike + deathtouch  is pretty damn good. Basically unkillible in combat and would be a limited Allstar.

Rakdos, Lord of Riots interaction with Chorus of the Conclave|> 601.2f The player determines the total cost of the spell. Usually this is just the mana cost. Some spells have additional or alternative costs. Some effects may increase or reduce the cost to pay, or may provide other alternative costs. Costs may include paying mana, tapping permanents, sacrificing permanents, discarding cards, and so on. The total cost is the mana cost or alternative cost (as determined in rule 601.2b), **plus all additional costs and cost increases, and minus all cost reductions.** If multiple cost reductions apply, the player may apply them in any order. If the mana component of the total cost is reduced to nothing by cost reduction effects, it is considered to be {0}. It can’t be reduced to less than {0}. Once the total cost is determined, any effects that directly affect the total cost are applied. Then the resulting total cost becomes “locked in.” If effects would change the total cost after this time, they have no effect.  Additional costs like Chorus of the Conclave are applied before cost reductions like Rakdos, Lord of Riots. I think this interaction works the way you were hoping!

Essentials for Every Magic Player: Heuristics & The Importance of Building Good Habits|This is similar to one of the main topics in Chapin's Next Level Magic book, which isn't surprising since it's essentially promoting the required and essential habits which lead to better play. The most important thing to improving isn't results focused thinking like counting wins and getting hung up on losses, it's consistency, good habits/foundation, and the mindset of trying to play as tight and close to perfect a game as possible. Misplays and preventing them are the one thing you have absolute control over in Magic.
Kaladesh and Amonkhet missing from Arena?|Arena went to public beta around the time of rotation and they (wisely, imo) decided it would be better to punt the decisions about how to handle rotated cards until the 2019 rotation. Kaladesh and Amonkhet will surely be back at some point, since they want the Pioneer format to be playable on Arena.
Need help explaining priority|During a player's turn, the active player gets priority first during each step or phase, then the nonactive player. There's never a time where the active player will get priority during a step or phase and the nonactive player will not get priority. During your upkeep, you get priority first, but eventually, you will have to pass priority to your opponent, at which point they can activate their fight ability.

Bonus bucks on TCGplayer|TCG player promos are why I switched to Card Kingdom. They are so inconsistent and often punish players for buying too soon into their sales. For example, they have a promo of 8% bonus bucks, I buy cards, then they decide they haven't made enough money and make an announcement that they have switched it to 10% bonus bucks. Why not do it the other way around? I lose out on savings because I act fast?

The geomancer and the beastcaller are primary melee, and the beastcaller has a permanent pet. But otherwise, the spells are all just different types of area damage and summons. I know the differences will emerge more in actual play but this is how it looks to me at this time.

I love the idea of using these low power intro decks to show people the ropes. It reminds me of when I bought the Life for Death intro pack and learned how to play the game myself.   Good choice for one of each chancellor as well. They’re simple enough and feel like a bomb to new comers. Honestly bravo all around. I could see this being done with other blocks like Innistrad or WAR.
Calling All Pauper players in Toronto!|I'm very onboard. I'm missing one or two cards and I probably should update my list in some way (plus I'm no good at the game, but frankly just an opportunity to play pauper with anyone else is fantastic), but I should be able to be ready for Sunday. You should contact the U of T board games club, I know they have 2 or 3 pauper players in there including their head of MtG and one of their commander regulars at least.

Y'know, getting in touch with the flow of the universe, seeing sights beyond my imagination floating in the aether every morning, that sort of thing. And my mate was offering a swirl in a great pad with loads of room, so I jumped at it. Turns out, it's not all it's cracked up to be. Sometimes, I get home from work and time will be all twisted about, and I'll have to go straight back out again with no dinner and no sleep. Not that I can sleep, anyway, when my bed, my walls, my window are all made of pure, streaming light. And my mate keeps making all these random elk and plants and dragons appear with no rhyme or reason, and not only that but he's always so hasty with making the decisions.

Selesnya appreciates that Boros cares for all of it's members and has a pretty organized system. They admire how Boros protects the weak from the strong and how efficient they are when they work as a team.    Boros feels similarily about Selesnya because they're both white. Boros doesn't have to do as much work when Selesnya can sometimes take care of some of their assignments.         But Boros doesn't like the ""culty"" vibe they get from Selesnya. It creeps them out and they probably don't want to become assimilated into the conclave.   The Selesnya thinks Boros doesn't have enough appreciation for nature and spends too much time worrying about the law. They also think that while they are organized, they are still somewhat segregated due to their hierarchy and red nature, making them not as cohesive as the conclave."

What are some fun commanders?!|Try Atris, Oracle of half truths, you can build around that commander any way you want
I made a Storm Counter ⛈|don't play Storm....still want
How can Ramunap Ruins be sacrificed to its own ability and yet deal damage to a player when the ability resolves?|What Ramunap Ruins is kind of doing is throwing a grenade.  If you remove the thrower, the grenade is still on its way, and will explode.
Atraxa, Protector of the Planes|When has infinite combo's been a draw?  You know what makes a fun game of commander?  Not infinite combos.
Pioneering Pioneer 1: Dimir Turbo Mill|I hope you enjoy this! If you have any suggestions or build and play this deck, please tell me! Thanks
MY budget Burn deck. Please grade this deck. Im mostly casual, did my first modern tournament a few weeks ago with an Angel deck, came to realize I need a faster deck. Wanted to give this a try. Im not looking to win it all, just be competitive. And mostly just have fun.|Seems fine to me. I'm used to looking at pauper burn so im not sure what i would recomend adding thats in modern.  maybe something like thermo alchemist or firebrand archer. cheap creatures that benfit from your spell slinging. though using them means you might have to ditch most of the elementals.   or if you like the elemental strategy, i remember there being a ball lightning tribal deck running around modern last summer. thunder kin + ball lightning/lightning skelemental = profits.
Youtubers The Nitpicking Nerds have spent the past half year ranking every (!) Commander. Today they are finally unveiling their top 10!|Got the list?  Found it, now you don't have to watch the video:   * The Gitrog Monster * Yawgmoth, Thran Physician * The Scarab God * Muldrotha, the Gravetide * Marchesa, the Black Rose * Atraxa, Praetors' Voice	 * Aminatou, the Fateshifter * Kruphix, God of Horizons * Queen Marchesa * Breya, Etherium Shaper
What Sleeves to Use? (Double Sleeving)|For the inner sleeves, you can use KMC Perfect Fit or Dragon Shield Perfect Fit, they're both the same size that you want. Dragon Shield sealable inner sleeves are also fine. Don't use KMC Perfect Hard, those are very thick inner sleeves, unless that's what you really want. Katanas are slightly different from KMC Hypers, if you really do get a pack of Hypers that are as good as the old ones, it won't matter which one you pick. I probably slightly prefer old Hypers, but I use Katanas right now. One thing to note is that the fronts of white Katanas are off-white instead of pure white, and KMC Hypers in light colors like white probably aren't as opaque as Katanas. Not a huge deal unless you play at tournaments and/or use double-sided cards.
Sushi, anyone?|Did you make this? This is awesome. I love it.
